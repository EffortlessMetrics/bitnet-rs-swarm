# Docs/Reports Archive Migration - Quick Reference

**Status**: Ready to Execute  
**Files to Archive**: 53 markdown files (460 KB)  
**Migration Time**: 15-20 minutes  
**Risk Level**: LOW  

---

## One-Liner Execution

```bash
./scripts/archive_reports.sh --dry-run && ./scripts/archive_reports.sh
```

---

## What's Happening

**Before**:
- `docs/reports/` contains 53 historical reports (Sept-Oct 2025)
- Root files reference these reports
- Lychee checks broken links in archived files

**After**:
- `docs/archive/reports/` contains same 53 files with tombstone banners
- Each file links to current authoritative documentation
- Lychee excludes archive from link checks

---

## The 5-Minute Workflow

```bash
# 1. Preview (30 seconds)
./scripts/archive_reports.sh --dry-run

# 2. Execute (2 minutes)
./scripts/archive_reports.sh

# 3. Verify (3 minutes)
git status
git diff | head -100
ls -la docs/archive/reports/ | head -5

# 4. Commit (1 minute)
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(docs): archive legacy reports to docs/archive/reports/"

# 5. Confirm (optional)
git log --oneline -n 5
```

## Updated Cross-References

These 4 files will be updated automatically:

1. `COMPREHENSIVE_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`
2. `DOCS_LINK_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
3. `ISSUE_254_SHAPE_MISMATCH_RESEARCH_REPORT.md`
4. `CARGO_FEATURE_FLAG_AUDIT.md`

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

```bash
./scripts/archive_reports.sh --rollback
```

This will:
- Move files back to `docs/reports/`
- Remove banners
- Restore cross-references
- Remove archive directory

---

## What's Safe

✅ Code dependencies: 0 (safe to migrate)  
✅ Git history: Preserved via `git mv`  
✅ External links: Unaffected  
✅ Active development: No blockers  

---

## What's New

✅ Archive directory: `docs/archive/reports/`  
✅ Tombstone banners: 53 files  
✅ Lychee exclusions: Updated  
✅ Cross-references: Updated (4 files)  

---

## Key Facts

- **53 files** → 460 KB
- **4 destinations** for current docs
- **0 code changes** needed
- **15-20 minutes** total time
- **100% reversible** with rollback
