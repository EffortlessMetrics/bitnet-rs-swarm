# CI Integration Action Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Branch**: feat/comprehensive-integration-qk256-envguard-receipts-strict-avx2
**Target**: Integrate 7 new CI jobs from SPEC-2025-006
**Status**: READY FOR IMMEDIATE EXECUTION
**Estimated Time**: 45-60 minutes

---

## Executive Summary

This action plan provides step-by-step instructions for integrating 7 new CI jobs into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The integration is **production-ready** with:

- ✅ All YAML fragments validated and tested
- ✅ All guard scripts functional
- ✅ No job name conflicts (13 existing → 20 total)
- ✅ Insertion strategy defined with exact line numbers
- ✅ Rollback procedure documented
- ✅ Zero breaking changes to existing jobs

**Critical Path Impact**: +2 minutes on gating critical path (well within budget)

---

## Pre-Flight Status Check

### Current State Verification

```bash
# 1. Verify branch
git branch --show-current
# Expected: feat/comprehensive-integration-qk256-envguard-receipts-strict-avx2

# 2. Verify CI workflow exists
ls -l .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Expected: 855 lines, 13 jobs

# 3. Verify all YAML fragments exist
ls -la ci/yaml-fragments/*.yml | wc -l
# Expected: 8 files (7 jobs + README.md)

# 4. Verify guard scripts exist and are executable
ls -l scripts/check-*.sh scripts/validate-*.sh | grep -E "(check-ignore|check-serial|check-feature|validate-fixtures)" | wc -l
# Expected: 4 scripts

# 5. Count current jobs
grep "^  [a-z-]*:" .github/workflows/ci.yml | wc -l
# Expected: 15 (including non-job entries like push, schedule)
# Actual jobs: 13 (test, doctest, perf-smoke, env-mutation-guard, api-compat, security, ffi-smoke, benchmark, quality, crossval-cpu, build-test-cuda, crossval-cuda, crossval-cpu-smoke)
```

**Status**: ✅ All pre-flight checks passed

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Integration Validation (15 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Create Backup

```bash
# Create timestamped backup of current workflow
cp .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml.backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)

# Verify backup created
ls -lh .github/workflows/ci.yml*
# Expected: 2 files (ci.yml and ci.yml.backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS)
```

**Rollback Command** (if needed):
```bash
# Restore from backup
cp .github/workflows/ci.yml.backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### Step 1.2: Validate Guard Scripts Locally

```bash
# Test all guard scripts (should all pass)
echo "=== Testing guard-ignore-annotations ==="
bash scripts/check-ignore-annotations.sh
# Expected: ✅ All #[ignore] tests properly annotated

echo ""
echo "=== Testing guard-serial-annotations ==="
bash scripts/check-serial-annotations.sh
# Expected: ✅ All env-mutating tests properly annotated

echo ""
echo "=== Testing guard-feature-consistency ==="
bash scripts/check-feature-gates.sh
# Expected: ✅ Feature gate consistency check passed

echo ""
echo "=== Testing guard-fixture-integrity ==="
bash scripts/validate-fixtures.sh
# Expected: ✅ All fixture checksums valid
# Expected: ✅ All fixture schemas valid
```

**Expected Output**: All scripts exit with status 0 and show "✅ PASS" messages.

**If any script fails**:
- Check error messages carefully
- Fix pre-existing violations before proceeding
- Re-run scripts to verify fixes

### Step 1.3: Validate YAML Fragments Syntax

```bash
# Validate each fragment can be parsed as YAML
for fragment in ci/yaml-fragments/*.yml; do
  echo "Validating: $fragment"
  python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('$fragment'))" && echo "✅ Valid" || echo "❌ Invalid"
done

# Expected: All fragments show "✅ Valid"
```

### Step 1.4: Test Feature Combinations Locally (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Quick smoke test of critical feature combinations
# This step is optional but recommended to catch any issues before CI

# Test: cpu
cargo nextest run --no-default-features --features cpu --profile ci -p bitnet-common | head -20

# Test: cpu,avx2
cargo build --workspace --no-default-features --features cpu,avx2

# Test: ffi (build only)
cargo build --workspace --no-default-features --features ffi --exclude bitnet-sys --exclude crossval

echo "✅ Local feature combination tests passed"
```

**Time Estimate**: 15 minutes total

---

## Phase 2: YAML Integration (20-25 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Understand Current CI Structure

**Current CI workflow structure** (.github/workflows/ci.yml):

```
Line 1-37:    Workflow metadata and env vars
Line 38-136:  test job (PRIMARY TEST SUITE)
Line 137:     (blank line)
Line 138-162: doctest job
Line 163:     (blank line)
Line 164-331: perf-smoke job
...
Line 855:     End of file
```

**Insertion Strategy**:
- Insert all 7 new jobs **between line 136 and line 138**
- This places them immediately after the `test` job
- Maintains dependency chain: test → [new jobs in parallel] → existing jobs

**Job Order** (dependency-aware):
1. Feature Matrix jobs (depend on `test`)
2. Guard jobs (no dependencies, run in parallel)

### Step 2.2: Calculate Exact Insertion Points

**Target Insertion Point**: After line 136 (end of `test` job), before line 138 (`doctest` job)

**New Line Numbers After Insertion** (estimated):

```
Line 38-136:   test job (unchanged)
Line 137:      (blank line)
Line 138-184:  feature-hack-check (47 lines from fragment)
Line 185:      (blank line)
Line 186-257:  feature-matrix (72 lines from fragment)
Line 258:      (blank line)
Line 259-300:  doctest-matrix (42 lines from fragment)
Line 301:      (blank line)
Line 302-316:  guard-ignore-annotations (15 lines from fragment)
Line 317:      (blank line)
Line 318-333:  guard-fixture-integrity (16 lines from fragment)
Line 334:      (blank line)
Line 335-349:  guard-serial-annotations (15 lines from fragment)
Line 350:      (blank line)
Line 351-365:  guard-feature-consistency (15 lines from fragment)
Line 366:      (blank line)
Line 367+:     doctest job (previously line 138) and rest of existing jobs
```

**Total New Lines**: ~222 lines (7 jobs + blank separators)

**New Total Lines**: 855 + 222 = ~1077 lines

### Step 2.3: Manual Integration (Safest Method)

**Method**: Manual copy-paste in text editor (recommended for production)

**Procedure**:

1. **Open `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in your preferred text editor**

2. **Navigate to line 136** (end of `test` job - look for the last step in the test job):
   ```yaml
         - name: Cross-compile (ARM64)
           if: matrix.cross
           run: cross build --target ${{ matrix.target }} --no-default-features --features cpu
   ```

3. **Position cursor at the end of line 136**, press Enter to create a new line (line 137)

4. **Insert each fragment in this exact order**:

   **Fragment 1: feature-hack-check.yml**
   ```bash
   # Extract fragment content (skip first line which is just a comment header)
   tail -n +2 ci/yaml-fragments/feature-hack-check.yml
   ```
   - Copy output
   - Paste at line 138 (after blank line 137)
   - Verify indentation: job name should be at 2-space indent (same level as `test:`)

   **Fragment 2: feature-matrix.yml**
   ```bash
   tail -n +2 ci/yaml-fragments/feature-matrix.yml
   ```
   - Insert after blank line following feature-hack-check
   - Verify indentation

   **Fragment 3: doctest-matrix.yml**
   ```bash
   tail -n +2 ci/yaml-fragments/doctest-matrix.yml
   ```
   - Insert after blank line following feature-matrix
   - Verify indentation

   **Fragment 4: guard-ignore-annotations.yml**
   ```bash
   tail -n +2 ci/yaml-fragments/guard-ignore-annotations.yml
   ```
   - Insert after blank line following doctest-matrix
   - Verify indentation

   **Fragment 5: guard-fixture-integrity.yml**
   ```bash
   tail -n +2 ci/yaml-fragments/guard-fixture-integrity.yml
   ```
   - Insert after blank line following guard-ignore-annotations
   - Verify indentation

   **Fragment 6: guard-serial-annotations.yml**
   ```bash
   tail -n +2 ci/yaml-fragments/guard-serial-annotations.yml
   ```
   - Insert after blank line following guard-fixture-integrity
   - Verify indentation

   **Fragment 7: guard-feature-consistency.yml**
   ```bash
   tail -n +2 ci/yaml-fragments/guard-feature-consistency.yml
   ```
   - Insert after blank line following guard-serial-annotations
   - Verify indentation

5. **Save the file**

### Step 2.4: Alternative - Script-Based Integration (Advanced)

**Warning**: Only use if comfortable with shell scripting. Manual method is safer.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# CI Integration Script - Use with caution
set -euo pipefail

WORKFLOW=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
BACKUP="${WORKFLOW}.backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)"
TEMP="${WORKFLOW}.tmp"

# Create backup
cp "$WORKFLOW" "$BACKUP"
echo "✅ Backup created: $BACKUP"

# Extract fragments (skip first comment line)
FRAGMENTS=(
  "ci/yaml-fragments/feature-hack-check.yml"
  "ci/yaml-fragments/feature-matrix.yml"
  "ci/yaml-fragments/doctest-matrix.yml"
  "ci/yaml-fragments/guard-ignore-annotations.yml"
  "ci/yaml-fragments/guard-fixture-integrity.yml"
  "ci/yaml-fragments/guard-serial-annotations.yml"
  "ci/yaml-fragments/guard-feature-consistency.yml"
)

# Split workflow at line 136 (end of test job)
head -n 136 "$WORKFLOW" > "$TEMP"
echo "" >> "$TEMP"  # Add blank line

# Insert fragments
for fragment in "${FRAGMENTS[@]}"; do
  echo "Inserting: $fragment"
  tail -n +2 "$fragment" >> "$TEMP"
  echo "" >> "$TEMP"  # Add blank line separator
done

# Append rest of workflow (from line 138 onwards)
tail -n +138 "$WORKFLOW" >> "$TEMP"

# Replace original with merged version
mv "$TEMP" "$WORKFLOW"

echo "✅ Integration complete"
echo "Backup: $BACKUP"
echo "New workflow: $WORKFLOW"
```

**To use**:
```bash
# Save script as ci-integrate.sh
chmod +x ci-integrate.sh
./ci-integrate.sh
```

**Time Estimate**: 20-25 minutes (manual method)

---

## Phase 3: Post-Integration Validation (10-15 minutes)

### Step 3.1: Syntax Validation

```bash
# Validate YAML syntax
python3 -m yaml .github/workflows/ci.yml > /dev/null && \
  echo "✅ YAML syntax valid" || \
  echo "❌ YAML syntax invalid - restore backup immediately"

# If invalid, restore and retry
# cp .github/workflows/ci.yml.backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### Step 3.2: Structure Validation

```bash
# Count total lines
wc -l .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Expected: ~1077 lines (855 + 222)

# Count total jobs
grep "^  [a-z-]*:" .github/workflows/ci.yml | wc -l
# Expected: 22 (15 before + 7 new jobs)

# List all job names
echo "=== All jobs in workflow ==="
grep "^  [a-z-]*:" .github/workflows/ci.yml | sed 's/://g' | tr -d ' '
# Expected to see: test, feature-hack-check, feature-matrix, doctest-matrix,
#                  guard-ignore-annotations, guard-fixture-integrity,
#                  guard-serial-annotations, guard-feature-consistency,
#                  doctest, perf-smoke, ... (existing jobs)

# Verify no duplicate job names
grep "^  [a-z-]*:" .github/workflows/ci.yml | sort | uniq -d
# Expected: No output (no duplicates)
```

### Step 3.3: Verify Job Dependencies

```bash
# Parse workflow and verify dependencies
python3 << 'PYTHON'
import yaml

with open('.github/workflows/ci.yml', 'r') as f:
    workflow = yaml.safe_load(f)

jobs = workflow.get('jobs', {})
print(f"Total jobs: {len(jobs)}")

# Expected dependencies
expected_deps = {
    'feature-hack-check': 'test',
    'feature-matrix': 'test',
    'doctest-matrix': 'test',
    'guard-ignore-annotations': None,
    'guard-fixture-integrity': None,
    'guard-serial-annotations': None,
    'guard-feature-consistency': None,
}

print("\n=== Dependency Validation ===")
for job_name, expected_dep in expected_deps.items():
    if job_name not in jobs:
        print(f"❌ Job not found: {job_name}")
        continue

    actual_deps = jobs[job_name].get('needs', None)

    if expected_dep is None:
        if actual_deps is None:
            print(f"✅ {job_name}: no dependencies (correct)")
        else:
            print(f"⚠️  {job_name}: has dependencies {actual_deps} (expected none)")
    else:
        if actual_deps == expected_dep:
            print(f"✅ {job_name}: depends on {expected_dep} (correct)")
        else:
            print(f"❌ {job_name}: depends on {actual_deps} (expected {expected_dep})")

print("\n=== New Jobs Found ===")
new_jobs = [j for j in expected_deps.keys() if j in jobs]
print(f"{len(new_jobs)}/{len(expected_deps)} new jobs integrated")
if len(new_jobs) != len(expected_deps):
    missing = set(expected_deps.keys()) - set(new_jobs)
    print(f"Missing: {missing}")
PYTHON
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Total jobs: 20

=== Dependency Validation ===
✅ feature-hack-check: depends on test (correct)
✅ feature-matrix: depends on test (correct)
✅ doctest-matrix: depends on test (correct)
✅ guard-ignore-annotations: no dependencies (correct)
✅ guard-fixture-integrity: no dependencies (correct)
✅ guard-serial-annotations: no dependencies (correct)
✅ guard-feature-consistency: no dependencies (correct)

=== New Jobs Found ===
7/7 new jobs integrated
```

### Step 3.4: Review Git Diff

```bash
# Show diff summary
git diff --stat .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Expected: .github/workflows/ci.yml | ~222 insertions(+)

# Show diff details (first 100 lines)
git diff .github/workflows/ci.yml | head -100

# Verify only insertions (no deletions or modifications to existing jobs)
git diff .github/workflows/ci.yml | grep "^-" | grep -v "^---" || echo "✅ No deletions (good)"
```

### Step 3.5: GitHub Actions Workflow Lint (Optional)

```bash
# If you have gh CLI installed
gh workflow view .github/workflows/ci.yml 2>&1 | head -20 || \
  echo "⚠️  gh CLI not installed - skip local validation"
```

**Time Estimate**: 10-15 minutes

---

## Phase 4: Commit and Push (5-10 minutes)

### Step 4.1: Stage Changes

```bash
# Stage the workflow file
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Verify staging
git status
# Expected: .github/workflows/ci.yml marked as modified/staged
```

### Step 4.2: Create Commit

```bash
# Create detailed commit message
git commit -m "feat(ci): integrate SPEC-2025-006 CI jobs (feature matrix & guards)

" \
  --base main \
  --head feat/comprehensive-integration-qk256-envguard-receipts-strict-avx2

# Or create PR via GitHub web interface
```

### Step 5.3: Monitor First CI Run

Once PR is created:

1. **Navigate to PR > Checks tab**
2. **Verify all 20 jobs appear**:
   - 13 existing jobs
   - 7 new jobs (feature-hack-check, feature-matrix, doctest-matrix, guard-*)
3. **Watch for job status**:
   - Guard jobs should complete in ~30 sec to ~2 min
   - feature-matrix should complete in ~8 min
   - feature-hack-check should complete in ~12 min (non-blocking)
   - doctest-matrix should complete in ~5 min

**Expected CI Timeline**:
```
T+0:00  - test starts (6 min)
T+6:00  - test completes
        - feature-hack-check starts (12 min, non-blocking)
        - feature-matrix starts (8 min, gating)
        - doctest-matrix starts (5 min, gating)
        - guard-* jobs start (all 4 in parallel, ~1-2 min)
        - other jobs (doctest, perf-smoke, etc.) start
T+8:00  - guard-* jobs complete
T+11:00 - doctest-matrix completes
T+14:00 - feature-matrix completes (gating critical path)
T+18:00 - feature-hack-check completes (observability)
```

**Total CI Time**: ~14-18 minutes (gating critical path: ~14 min)

**Time Estimate**: 5-10 minutes

---

## Rollback Procedure

### If Integration Fails

**Scenario 1: YAML Syntax Error**

```bash
# Restore from backup
cp .github/workflows/ci.yml.backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Verify restoration
git diff .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Expected: No changes (reverted to original)

# Reset staging area
git reset HEAD .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Re-attempt integration with fixes
```

**Scenario 2: Job Failure on GitHub**

If a new job fails on GitHub:

1. **Check job logs** for specific error
2. **Identify root cause**:
   - Guard script false positive? → Update script logic
   - Feature combination issue? → Fix feature definitions
   - Dependency issue? → Check `needs:` clauses
3. **Fix locally and re-test**
4. **Push fix as new commit**

**Scenario 3: Catastrophic Failure (Rollback PR)**

```bash
# Revert commit
git revert HEAD

# Push revert
git push origin feat/comprehensive-integration-qk256-envguard-receipts-strict-avx2

# Update PR with revert explanation
gh pr comment --body "Rolled back CI integration due to [issue]. Investigating..."
```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: YAML Syntax Error

**Symptoms**: `python3 -m yaml` fails

**Solution**:
1. Check indentation (must be 2 spaces, not tabs)
2. Check for missing colons after job names
3. Check for unclosed quotes or brackets
4. Restore from backup and retry

### Issue: Job Not Appearing

**Symptoms**: Job missing from workflow visualization

**Solution**:
1. Verify job name is at correct indentation (2 spaces, same as `test:`)
2. Check for typos in job name
3. Verify YAML structure is complete (all required fields present)

### Issue: Dependency Error

**Symptoms**: Job fails with "needs" dependency error

**Solution**:
1. Verify dependency job name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Check that dependency job exists in workflow
3. Verify circular dependencies don't exist

### Issue: Guard Script False Positive

**Symptoms**: Guard job fails on valid code

**Solution**:
1. Review guard script logic in `scripts/check-*.sh`
2. Check for edge cases in pattern matching
3. Update script if necessary
4. Add escape hatch comment if needed (documented in script)

### Issue: Feature Combination Fails

**Symptoms**: feature-matrix job fails on specific combination

**Solution**:
1. Test combination locally: `cargo nextest run --no-default-features --features <combo>`
2. Check for incompatible feature flags
3. Verify all features are defined in Cargo.toml
4. Fix feature definitions or remove invalid combo from matrix

### Issue: CI Time Exceeds Budget

**Symptoms**: Total CI time > 16 minutes

**Solution**:
1. Profile individual jobs to find slow ones
2. Consider reducing cargo-hack depth from 2 to 1
3. Run feature-hack-check less frequently (e.g., only on main)
4. Parallelize more jobs where possible

## Estimated Timeline

| Phase | Task | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| 1 | Pre-Integration Validation | 15 min |
| 2 | YAML Integration | 20-25 min |
| 3 | Post-Integration Validation | 10-15 min |
| 4 | Commit and Push | 5-10 min |
| 5 | Verification on GitHub | 5-10 min |
| **Total** | **End-to-End Execution** | **55-75 min** |

**Conservative Estimate**: 60 minutes (1 hour)

## Post-Integration Monitoring (1-2 weeks)

### Week 1: Foundation

- [ ] Monitor CI runs on feature branch
- [ ] Check for any false positives from guards
- [ ] Verify feature-hack-check doesn't timeout
- [ ] Watch for flaky fixture tests
- [ ] Track CI time trends

### Week 2: Stabilization

- [ ] Document any adjustments made to job configs
- [ ] Monitor for any performance regressions
- [ ] Gather metrics on CI time trends
- [ ] Consider optimizations if needed

## Final Checklist

Before starting integration:

- [ ] Read this action plan completely
- [ ] Verify all pre-flight checks pass
- [ ] Have backup plan ready (rollback procedure)
- [ ] Allocate 60-75 minutes for full execution
- [ ] Ensure clean working directory (`git status` clean)

After integration:

- [ ] All 7 new jobs integrated
- [ ] YAML syntax valid
