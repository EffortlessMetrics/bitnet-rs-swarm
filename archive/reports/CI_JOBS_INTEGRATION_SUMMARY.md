# CI Jobs Integration Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Branch**: feat/comprehensive-integration-qk256-envguard-receipts-strict-avx2
**Deliverable**: Successfully integrated 7 YAML fragments into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

## Changes Overview

### Jobs Added (7 new jobs)

Successfully integrated the following jobs from `ci/yaml-fragments/`:

1. **feature-hack-check** (NON-BLOCKING)
   - Name: "Feature Matrix (cargo-hack powerset)"
   - Purpose: Observability for feature gate consistency using cargo-hack
   - Status: `continue-on-error: true` (non-blocking)
   - Dependencies: `needs: test`

2. **feature-matrix** (BLOCKING)
   - Name: "Feature Matrix Tests (curated)"
   - Purpose: Gates CI - must pass for merge
   - Tests critical feature combinations: cpu, cpu+avx2, cpu+fixtures, ffi, gpu (compile-only)
   - Dependencies: `needs: test`

3. **doctest-matrix** (BLOCKING for CPU, observational for all-features)
   - Name: "Doctests (Feature Matrix)"
   - Purpose: Validates documentation examples across feature sets
   - Features tested: cpu, cpu+avx2, all-features
   - Status: `continue-on-error: true` only for all-features variant
   - Dependencies: `needs: test`

4. **guard-fixture-integrity** (BLOCKING)
   - Name: "Guard - Fixture Integrity"
   - Purpose: Validates fixture checksums, schema, and alignment
   - Script: `scripts/validate-fixtures.sh`

5. **guard-serial-annotations** (BLOCKING)
   - Name: "Guard - Serial Annotations"
   - Purpose: Ensures env-mutating tests have `#[serial(bitnet_env)]`
   - Script: `scripts/check-serial-annotations.sh`

6. **guard-feature-consistency** (BLOCKING)
   - Name: "Guard - Feature Consistency"
   - Purpose: Cross-checks `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` with defined features
   - Script: `scripts/check-feature-gates.sh`

7. **guard-ignore-annotations** (NON-BLOCKING)
   - Name: "Guard - Ignore Annotations"
   - Purpose: Ensures all `#[ignore]` tests have issue references or justification
   - Status: `continue-on-error: true` (non-blocking due to 134 bare #[ignore] markers)
   - Script: `scripts/check-ignore-annotations.sh`

## Pragmatic Guard Configuration

### Non-Blocking Guards (2)

1. **feature-hack-check**: `continue-on-error: true`
   - Reason: Observability for feature combinations, not a hard gate

2. **guard-ignore-annotations**: `continue-on-error: true`
   - Reason: 134 bare `#[ignore]` markers exist; blocking would prevent merges
   - Strategy: Observational until annotation backlog is resolved

### Blocking Guards (5)

1. **feature-matrix**: Gates CI - must pass
2. **doctest-matrix**: Gates CI for CPU features (all-features is observational)
3. **guard-fixture-integrity**: Gates CI - fixture validation required
4. **guard-serial-annotations**: Gates CI - env isolation required
5. **guard-feature-consistency**: Gates CI - feature gate hygiene required

## YAML Syntax Validation

✅ **YAML syntax is valid** - Validated with Python `yaml.safe_load()`

---

## File Locations

- **Main CI Workflow**: `/home/steven/code/Rust/BitNet-rs/.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **YAML Fragments**: `/home/steven/code/Rust/BitNet-rs/ci/yaml-fragments/*.yml`
- **Guard Scripts**:
  - `scripts/validate-fixtures.sh`
  - `scripts/check-serial-annotations.sh`
  - `scripts/check-feature-gates.sh`
  - `scripts/check-ignore-annotations.sh`

---

## Integration Details

### Insertion Point

Jobs inserted after line 136 (after cross-compile step in `test` job) and before existing `doctest` job.

### Indentation

All jobs use 2-space indentation, consistent with existing workflow style.

### Dependencies

All new jobs depend on `test` job completion via `needs: test` (except guards which are independent).

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Integration Complete** - All 7 jobs successfully added
2. ⏭️ **CI Validation** - Push to trigger workflow and validate all jobs execute
3. ⏭️ **Guard Script Validation** - Ensure all guard scripts exist and execute correctly
4. ⏭️ **Documentation** - Update CI documentation with new job descriptions
