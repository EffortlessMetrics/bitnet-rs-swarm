## Key Insights and Findings

### 1. I2S Quantization is Robust ✅

**Strengths**:
- Handles NaN/Inf gracefully (maps to zero)
- Extreme dynamic ranges handled with clipping
- Error bounds within acceptable limits (max ≤ 1.0, mean ≤ 0.1)
- Statistical distribution preserved (6 moments validated)
- Deterministic reproducibility with BITNET_SEED

**Limitations**:
- Block-based scaling (32-elem blocks) causes sparsity loss (~40-50% error)
- Exact zeros dequantize to small non-zero values

### 2. TL1/TL2 Quantization Needs Attention ⚠️

**Issues Identified**:
- **TL1 Numerical Stability**: Poor accuracy (negative scores)
- **TL1 Sparsity**: Doesn't preserve sparsity at all (0% vs expected 88.7%)
- **TL2 Precision**: Similar to TL1 due to both using 2-bit quantization

**Recommendations**:
- Review TL1/TL2 quantization algorithm implementations
- Consider alternative approaches for sparse tensor quantization
- Adjust test thresholds or document expected behavior
- TL2's advantage is vectorized lookup tables, not precision

**Successes**:
- Revealed TL1 quantization limitations (stability, sparsity)
- Validated I2S robustness across edge cases
- Comprehensive coverage with 100+ iterations per test
- Identified need for threshold adjustments based on algorithm behavior

### 5. Memory Efficiency and Loading Optimizations Work ✅

**Validated**:

- Compression ratios realistic (10.66x for 2-bit quantization)
- Loading performance: 55-60 MB/s for 1.2GB models
- Memory overhead within expected bounds (≤4x for most cases)
