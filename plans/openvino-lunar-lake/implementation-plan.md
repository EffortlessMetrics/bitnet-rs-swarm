## Scope

This plan sequences OpenVINO Lunar Lake work in PR-sized increments. Phase A is
source-of-truth documentation and proof-boundary work. Later phases improve
validators, quality diagnosis, timing evidence, route promotion reviews, status
UX, Rust bridge surfaces, server readiness, and BitNet subgraph research.

The campaign must keep OpenVINO dense SLM, OpenVINO GPU, OpenVINO NPU, native
OpenCL, BitNet QK256, and server proof families separate.

## Phase A: Encode Docs and Proof Boundaries

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-DOCS-001

Status: merged
Campaign item: `LNL258V-OPENVINO-DOCS-001`

#### Goal

Add the OpenVINO Lunar Lake productization proposal, route contract, and
implementation plan.

#### Production delta

Docs/specs only. No runtime code, scripts, model artifacts, generated receipts,
or route promotion.

#### Acceptance

- Proposal defines why OpenVINO exists as a governed Intel-runtime lane.
- Route contract defines CPU/GPU/NPU identities, proof families, required
  receipt fields, fallback rules, and claim boundaries.
- Implementation plan lists PR-sized next steps.
- Campaign tracker adds docs/spec work items only.
- No runtime claims are promoted.

#### Claim boundary

No OpenVINO GPU/NPU route promotion, speedup, power advantage, broad dense SLM
quality, BitNet QK256, native OpenCL, cold one-off NPU usability, model-binary,
or server-readiness claim.

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-DOCS-002

Status: merged
Linked proposal: `BITNET-PROP-0004`
Linked specs: `BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-ROUTE-CONTRACT`, `BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-DENSE-SLM`
Blocked by: `LNL258V-OPENVINO-DOCS-001`

Add `docs/specs/BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-DENSE-SLM.md` defining dense SLM support
through OpenVINO GenAI, exact model/export contract fields, the proof ladder,
and profile-scoped promotion prerequisites. Do not promote any route.

Acceptance additions:

- Qwen2.5 0.5B Instruct has a precise OpenVINO artifact/export manifest
  contract.
- Future small LLM candidates must enter through the same manifest, smoke,
  answer, phase, route-profile, and promotion-review ladder.
- Dense SLM OpenVINO receipts remain separate from BitNet QK256/I2_S proof.

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-DOCS-003

Status: merged
Linked proposal: `BITNET-PROP-0004`
Linked specs: `BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-NPU-COLD-WARM-CACHE`
Blocked by: `LNL258V-OPENVINO-DOCS-002`

Add `docs/specs/BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-NPU-COLD-WARM-CACHE.md` defining NPU
first-ever compile, cached startup, warm second ask, resident session, cache,
`PREFILL_HINT`, `GENERATE_HINT`, `MAX_PROMPT_LEN`, and `MIN_RESPONSE_LEN`
receipt requirements. Do not claim cold one-off NPU usability.

Acceptance additions:

- First-ever cold, cached cold-process, warm same-process, and resident-session
  timing modes are separate receipt modes.
- NPU cache identity, cache hit/miss evidence, GenAI configuration, phase
  timing, answer quality, fallback, and route-promotion fields are required.
- Hot first-token/decode evidence alone cannot support cold one-off NPU
  usability, speedup, power-advantage, or route-promotion claims.

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-DOCS-004

Status: merged
Linked proposal: `BITNET-PROP-0004`
Linked specs: `BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-QUALITY-CORPUS`, `BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-PHASE-TIMING`
Blocked by: `LNL258V-OPENVINO-DOCS-003`

Add:

```text
docs/specs/BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-QUALITY-CORPUS.md
docs/specs/BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-PHASE-TIMING.md
```

Define corpus-v2 profile gates, failure taxonomy, retokenized token-ID marking,
prompt evidence, generation config, and profile-specific timing fields.

Acceptance additions:

- Quality corpus receipts define required profiles/categories, prompt/template
  evidence, stop/EOS policy, generation config, and direct versus retokenized
  token accounting.
- Phase timing receipts define profile token-bound applicability, cold/cache/
  warm/resident split, OpenVINO metric gaps, telemetry context, and comparison
  requirements.
- Quality and timing evidence are inputs to route-promotion review but do not
  promote OpenVINO GPU/NPU routes by themselves.

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-DOCS-005

Status: merged
Linked proposal: `BITNET-PROP-0004`
Linked specs: `BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-ROUTE-PROMOTION`, `BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-BITNET-BOUNDARY`

Add:

```text
docs/specs/BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-ROUTE-PROMOTION.md
docs/specs/BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-BITNET-BOUNDARY.md
```

Define route states, exact-profile promotion gates, and the separation between
OpenVINO dense SLM proof and BitNet QK256/I2_S proof.

Acceptance additions:

- Route-promotion spec defines candidate/promoted/blocked states,
  exact-profile promotion packages, invalidation, auto-route behavior, and
  CPU/GPU/NPU promotion gates.
- BitNet-boundary spec separates OpenVINO dense SLM, OpenVINO BitNet subgraph,
  native OpenCL, NPU, server, and CPU BitNet reference proof families.
- Dense SLM OpenVINO success cannot count as BitNet QK256/I2_S proof, and
  accelerator BitNet claims require CPU-reference parity plus exact
  kernel/subgraph timing evidence.

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-DOCS-006

Linked proposal: `BITNET-PROP-0004`
Linked specs: `BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-RUST-BRIDGE`, `BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-SERVER`

Add:

```text
docs/specs/BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-RUST-BRIDGE.md
docs/specs/BITNET-SPEC-OPENVINO-SERVER.md
```

Define the Python-to-Rust bridge stages and exact-profile server readiness only
after ask/chat route readiness.

Acceptance additions:

- Rust bridge spec defines staged proof from Python harness through Rust wrapper,
  validator, subprocess bridge, binding, and product surfaces.
- Server spec defines exact-profile server receipts, underlying route linkage,
  cold/warm timing, fallback behavior, exposure fields, and streaming/
  concurrency boundaries.
- Neither spec claims route promotion, broad server readiness, speedup, power
  advantage, or BitNet QK256/I2_S behavior.

## Phase B: Improve Receipt Validation and Status Without Runtime Promotion

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-VALIDATE-001

Status: merged
Blocked by: Phase A specs

Add validators for selected backend/device consistency, `fallback_used=false` on
strict routes, retokenized token-ID marking, no dense-SLM-to-BitNet claim leak,
no OpenVINO-GPU-to-native-OpenCL claim leak, and NPU cache/warm fields when NPU
promotion is attempted.

Production delta: receipt validation only. No inference, no route promotion, no
runtime execution change, and no committed hardware artifact refresh.

Acceptance additions:

- `bitnet-receipts-core` exposes a Lunar Lake OpenVINO receipt validator and
  synthetic rejection tests for fallback, device/backend mismatch, token-ID
  source ambiguity, claim leakage, and premature NPU promotion.
- `bitnet validate open-vino-lunar-lake --receipt <path>` runs the validator and
  can emit a validation summary without changing the source receipt.
- Existing committed OpenVINO corpus, phase, route-profile, route-promotion,
  operator-ask, and NPU cold-start diagnosis receipts pass the new validator.

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-VALIDATE-ASK-001

Status: merged
Linked issue: [#1445](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1445)
Linked PRs: [#1447](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/pull/1447), [#1450](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/pull/1450)
Blocked by: `LNL258V-OPENVINO-VALIDATE-001`, issue #1445

Add standalone validation for appliance-wrapped successful OpenVINO operator
ask receipts with `artifact_kind=lunar_lake_operator_ask`.

Production delta: receipt validation only. No inference, route-policy mutation,
route promotion, runtime execution change, committed hardware receipt refresh,
or generated-dashboard hand edit.

Acceptance additions:

- `bitnet validate open-vino-lunar-lake --receipt <path>` accepts committed
  successful OpenVINO appliance ask receipts for `ask_short`, `ask_normal`, and
  `warm_resident`.
- The wrapper validator requires OpenVINO route/backend/runtime identity,
  `fallback_used=false`, a passing answer gate, generated-token IDs with a
  matching count, tokenizer/source-run context, and no BitNet/QK256, native
  accelerator, speedup, power, or broad-quality claim leakage.
- CPU/Rust wrappers, backend/route mismatches, fallback, missing generated
  tokens, token-count drift, and claim leakage fail closed.
- Blocked `low_power` stays on the blocked-ask/regression path and is not
  treated as successful generated-token evidence.
- This item is closed. Future wrapper-shape gaps should reopen #1244 or create
  a new validator issue; they should not widen route policy or refresh
  hardware receipts in the same PR.

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-STATUS-001

Status: merged
Blocked by: `LNL258V-OPENVINO-VALIDATE-001`

Add `docs/status/OPENVINO_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md` with claim-neutral rows for
Qwen2.5 OpenVINO CPU/GPU/NPU and BitNet OpenVINO subgraph research.

Production delta: status documentation only. The matrix indexes current
candidate, promoted, diagnostic, and planned OpenVINO rows, the source receipts,
the validator command, and the claim boundaries without running inference or
promoting GPU/NPU routes.

Acceptance additions:

- OpenVINO CPU/GPU/NPU dense SLM rows link to the route ledger, route-profile
  comparison, corpus-v2, phase, NPU cold-start, and operator-ask evidence.
- BitNet OpenVINO rows remain diagnostic/planned subgraph research and do not
  imply BitNet QK256/I2_S, full accelerator inference, or QK256 decode proof.
- The status surface names the validation command and the blockers required
  before route promotion, speedup, power, or server claims can be made.

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-UX-001

Status: merged
Blocked by: `LNL258V-OPENVINO-STATUS-001`

Teach `receipts explain` to summarize OpenVINO route ID, selected backend,
device, proof family, quality status, timing scope, promotion status, blockers,
and what the receipt does not prove.

Production delta: operator UX only. `receipts explain` should make OpenVINO
candidate/proof boundaries readable from existing receipts without validating,
executing inference, changing route policy, or promoting GPU/NPU routes.

Acceptance additions:

- Text and JSON receipt explanations expose an OpenVINO block with route ID,
  backend/runtime/device identity, proof family, selected runtime, quality
  status, timing scope, promotion status, blockers, and claim limits.
- Candidate GPU/NPU receipts explicitly explain that they do not prove route
  promotion, speedup, native OpenCL/NPU execution, BitNet QK256/I2_S, full
  BitNet accelerator inference, or QK256 accelerator decode.
- Existing CUDA and model-coverage receipt explanation behavior remains intact.

## Phase C: Close Quality Gaps

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-QUAL-REPORT-001

Status: merged
Linked PR: #5633
Blocked by: `LNL258V-OPENVINO-UX-001`, `LNL258V-OV-QUAL-005`

Add `docs/reports/OPENVINO_LUNAR_LAKE_CORPUS_V2_FAILURES.md` and classify
existing OpenVINO GPU/NPU corpus-v2 failures by route, profile, case, and
failure class.

Production delta: diagnostic report and tracker wiring only. Use existing
committed receipts; do not run inference, change generation policy, promote
GPU/NPU routes, claim speedup or power advantage, or change BitNet QK256/I2_S
behavior.

Acceptance additions:

- GPU and NPU corpus-v2 failures are summarized from committed diagnosis
  receipts.
- Generation-budget sensitivity is linked for normalized-match failures.
- Candidate-route blockers remain explicit, including direct token-ID
  visibility gaps, benchmark-qualified advantage gaps, and NPU cold/resident
  gaps.
- Claim boundaries separate OpenVINO dense SLM evidence from native OpenCL,
  native NPU, and BitNet QK256/I2_S proof.

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-QUAL-POLICY-001

Status: merged
Linked PR: #5639
Blocked by: `LNL258V-OPENVINO-QUAL-REPORT-001`, `LNL258V-OV-QUAL-005`

Codify exact-answer generation policy for normalized-match OpenVINO corpus-v2
failures. The policy must distinguish fixture-budget overgeneration from true
exact-answer instruction misses, define when smaller-budget evidence may
justify a fixture or generation-policy change, and keep GPU/NPU routes blocked
until the accepted policy is rerun.

Production delta: spec and tracker wiring only. Do not edit corpus fixtures,
runner scripts, runtime code, committed hardware receipts, route promotion
artifacts, or OpenVINO generation behavior.

Acceptance additions:

- The quality-corpus spec defines exact-answer policy for overgeneration versus
  instruction misses.
- The spec names the current `yes_no_clear_sky` and
  `stop_token_one_word_done` policy outcomes from committed sensitivity
  evidence.
- Route promotion remains blocked until canonical fixture or generation policy
  changes are rerun, or a later accepted spec marks a case diagnostic-only.
- Claim boundaries preserve no inference, route promotion, speedup, power,
  accelerator, or BitNet QK256/I2_S claims.

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-QUAL-FIX-001

Status: merged
Linked PR: #5644
Blocked by: `LNL258V-OPENVINO-QUAL-POLICY-001`

Apply the accepted exact-answer policy to the corpus-v2 fixture by tightening
only the `yes_no_clear_sky` generation budget from the overgeneration-sensitive
fixture value to the tested passing one-token budget. Leave
`stop_token_one_word_done` unchanged because committed sensitivity evidence
classifies it as a true exact-answer instruction miss for the tested budgets.

Production delta: fixture and tracker wiring only. Validate with
`answer-corpus --dry-run`; do not run model inference, refresh committed route
receipts, promote routes, or claim OpenVINO quality, speedup, power advantage,
native OpenCL/NPU execution, accelerator proof, or BitNet QK256/I2_S behavior.

Acceptance additions:

- The canonical corpus-v2 fixture uses `max_new_tokens=1` for
  `yes_no_clear_sky`.
- The `stop_token_one_word_done` case remains a blocking exact-answer
  instruction miss until prompt, template, generation policy, or model behavior
  is corrected and rerun.
- Corpus shape dry-run validation passes without loading a model.
- Route promotion remains blocked until CPU/OpenVINO corpus-v2 receipts are
  rerun under the updated fixture and exact-profile timing/power gates are met.

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-QUAL-RERUN-001

Status: merged
Linked PR: #5650
Blocked by: `LNL258V-OPENVINO-QUAL-FIX-001`

Rerun the dense Qwen2.5 CPU and OpenVINO CPU/GPU/NPU corpus-v2 evidence after
the accepted exact-answer fixture-policy update. Align the Rust Qwen2.5 ChatML
generation marker with the exported tokenizer template, preserve exact
one-token answer scoring, refresh CPU/GPU/NPU diagnoses, and refresh the route
profile and regression-v2 indexes.

Production delta: dense Qwen prompt/scoring correction plus receipt rerun. Do
not promote GPU/NPU routes, claim speedup or power advantage, claim native
Arc/NPU acceleration, alter BitNet QK256/I2_S behavior, or treat dense SLM
evidence as BitNet proof.

Acceptance additions:

- Rust Qwen2.5 prompt rendering preserves the exported tokenizer template's
  assistant generation newline.
- Exact-scored one-token answers can pass without failing the generic generated
  token variation gate.
- `yes_no_clear_sky` passes after rerun on CPU, OpenVINO CPU, GPU.0, and NPU.
- Remaining OpenVINO candidate blockers are reclassified under the updated
  fixture, with GPU/NPU still unpromoted.
- Regression v2 indexes the updated corpus and route-profile evidence.

### Work item: LNL258V-OPENVINO-QUAL-RERUN-002

Status: merged
Linked PR: #5669
Blocked by: `LNL258V-QUAL-008`

Rerun OpenVINO CPU/GPU/NPU corpus-v2 candidate evidence after the canonical
`stop_token_one_word_done` fixture changed to the tested exact-lowercase
wording that passes on the dense GGUF CPU route.

Production delta: receipt refresh only. Do not promote GPU/NPU routes, claim
speedup or power advantage, claim native Arc/NPU acceleration, alter BitNet
QK256/I2_S behavior, or treat dense SLM evidence as BitNet proof.

Acceptance additions:

- OpenVINO CPU/GPU/NPU corpus-v2 receipt reflects the current canonical corpus.
- Generation-budget sensitivity for normalized-match cases is rerun against
  the current canonical fixture.
- OpenVINO CPU/GPU/NPU candidate blockers remain current and route-profile
  evidence stays candidate-only unless a separate promotion item proves
  exact-profile quality plus timing or power advantage.

### Work item: LNL258V-QUAL-009

Status: merged
Linked PR: #5674
Blocked by: `LNL258V-OPENVINO-QUAL-RERUN-002`

Tighten `stop_token_one_word_done` to a tested cross-runtime exact-text
fixture. The prior wording passes the promoted dense GGUF CPU route but still
fails OpenVINO CPU/GPU/NPU as `ai`; the replacement wording is the narrowest
known prompt that passes dense GGUF CPU and OpenVINO CPU/GPU/NPU without
changing route policy. Also keep route-profile budget sensitivity honest:
`fixture_budget_passes` is passing evidence, not a candidate blocker.

Production delta: corpus fixture and receipt refresh only. Do not promote
GPU/NPU routes, claim speedup or power advantage, claim native Arc/NPU
acceleration, alter BitNet QK256/I2_S behavior, or treat dense SLM evidence as
BitNet proof.

Acceptance additions:

- The canonical corpus-v2 stop-token fixture uses cross-runtime wording.
- Dense GGUF CPU and OpenVINO CPU/GPU/NPU corpus-v2 receipts are rerun.
- Route-profile budget sensitivity ignores passing fixture budgets as blockers.
- Route-profile/regression/comparison artifacts are refreshed and GPU/NPU
  routes remain candidate-only unless a separate promotion item proves exact
  profile quality plus timing or power advantage.

### Work item: LNL258V-QUAL-010

Status: merged
Linked PR: #5681
Merge commit: `baec0c19728f1eb7670aa0394def0ac71d0a5e8d`
Blocked by: `LNL258V-QUAL-009`

Tighten the remaining `prefill_heavy` and `decode_heavy` corpus-v2 fixtures to
tested cross-runtime wording. Local probes showed the previous prompts were too
brittle for OpenVINO candidate routes: CPU/GPU omitted required terms in the
long/decode cases, and NPU omitted a required term in the long case. The
replacement prompts explicitly carry the required terms while preserving the
profile roles.

Production delta: corpus fixture and receipt refresh only. Do not promote
GPU/NPU routes, claim speedup or power advantage, claim native Arc/NPU
acceleration, alter BitNet QK256/I2_S behavior, or treat dense SLM evidence as
BitNet proof.

Acceptance additions:

- The canonical prefill-heavy case includes explicit `Lunar`, `CPU`, and
  `route` term requirements in the prompt and scoring contract.
- The canonical decode-heavy case uses a stable route-check phrase bank that
  includes `fallback` and `model`.
- Dense GGUF CPU and OpenVINO CPU/GPU/NPU corpus-v2 receipts are rerun.
- Route-profile/regression/comparison artifacts are refreshed and GPU/NPU
  routes remain candidate-only unless a separate promotion item proves exact
  profile quality plus timing or power advantage.

### Remaining Phase C Items

1. Keep the corpus-v2 quality fixture current as route implementations change.
2. Preserve direct-versus-retokenized token visibility until OpenVINO GenAI can
   expose direct generated-token IDs.

The current quality blockers are closed, but no route can promote until
exact-profile timing, direct token visibility, fallback-free execution, and
benchmark-qualified latency/power evidence satisfy the promotion spec.

## Phase D: Close Performance Evidence Gaps

1. Add a profile-specific OpenVINO phase runner with prompt/output token counts,
   pipeline construction, tokenization, first chunk, TTFT, decode, throughput,
   perf metrics, and cache config.
2. Run GPU profile benchmarks for regression, ask, prefill, decode, and
   structured profiles.
3. Run NPU cold/cache/warm/resident benchmarks with cache and GenAI NPU config.
4. Upgrade power/thermal telemetry or record explicit unavailable reasons.

No speed or power claim is allowed without exact-profile benchmark
qualification.

## Phase E: Route Promotion Reviews

- GPU route promotion review may promote only exact profiles that pass quality,
  select GPU.0 / Arc 140V without fallback, include profile timing, compare
  against same-profile CPU evidence, and avoid OpenCL/BitNet claim leakage.
- NPU route promotion review may promote only exact warm/resident/low-power
  profiles that pass quality, select NPU without fallback, include cache and
  resident proof, expose cold-start caveats, and include power/thermal or
  accepted power-proxy evidence.

### Current Review-First Blockers

The active Lunar Lake lane should handle the remaining practical blockers as
research and review contracts before opening implementation or receipt-refresh
PRs:

- `LNL258V-POWER-006` stays blocked by issue
  [#1064](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1064)
  until a real battery-mode run produces strict before/after telemetry,
  fallback-free CPU/GPU/NPU `low_power` route samples, a valid energy proxy,
  thermal availability or explicit unavailability, and benchmark-qualified
  power-advantage evidence. AC-only telemetry, runbook receipts, ask telemetry
  context, or schema support remain blocker evidence only.
- NPU work stays under the cold/cache/warm contracts in
  [#1119](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1119)
  and [#1371](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1371).
  Hot-path latency alone must not broaden NPU promotion; cache behavior,
  resident stability, selected-device identity, fallback status, and cold-start
  caveats must remain visible.
- GPU promotion for `ask_short` and `ask_normal` is protected by the current
  review notes and guards, including
  [#1121](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1121)
  and [#1373](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1373).
  Future work should first review corpus-v2 quality, direct token visibility,
  route identity, profile timing, fallback, and benchmark qualification before
  changing the ledger.
- Rust GGUF CPU slow-path work stays diagnostic until the resident phase,
  matched CPU comparison, topology, or overhead issues identify a specific
  optimization target:
  [#1232](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1232),
  [#1365](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1365),
  [#1370](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1370),
  and [#1374](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1374).
  Do not optimize from the aggregate "CPU is slow" observation alone.

### Next No-Inference Guard Candidate

The previous no-inference guards are complete. Issue
[#1568](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1568)
landed through implementation PR #1593 and tracker closeout PR #1596, protecting
the Rust GGUF CPU versus OpenVINO CPU matched-comparison boundary from benchmark
qualification when non-format alignment gates are missing or contradicted.
Issue
[#1578](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1578)
landed through implementation PR #1599 and tracker closeout PR #1601, adding
machine-readable resident Rust GGUF CPU phase-attribution buckets while keeping
the resident evidence diagnostic and `benchmark_qualified=false`. Issue
[#1572](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1572)
landed through implementation PR #1605 and tracker closeout PR #1607, adding
dedicated `lunar_lake_openvino_npu_cache_truth` validation for cache-source
provenance without running inference, refreshing hardware receipts, promoting
NPU routes, or changing route policy.

The next no-inference guard should select
[#1571](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1571)
before any CPU tuning, thread-default or affinity change, OpenVINO CPU
replacement, route-policy mutation, benchmark expansion, `low_power` work, or
power/speedup claim. That issue narrows #1370 to a no-new-inference
topology/affinity availability contract: process affinity masks,
requested/effective thread counts, timing differences, zero values, or null
values must not be treated as P-core/E-core placement, worker affinity,
utilization, frequency/throttle, thermal, or scheduler-placement proof.

The first repo-native step under #1571 should be a tracker-ready PR for
`LNL258V-CPU-TOPOLOGY-GUARD-001` that names the exact branch, allowed paths,
proof commands, and claim boundaries. The first implementation PR after that
should use existing committed thread/core or resident receipts or synthetic
mutated fixtures only. It should require route/backend/runtime/model/tokenizer/
profile identity, fallback status, process and worker affinity status, topology
classification status, P-core/E-core mapping status, utilization/frequency/
throttle/thermal availability statuses with explicit unavailable reasons, power
context, `benchmark_qualified=false`, and claim-boundary fields for any
dedicated `lunar_lake_cpu_topology_affinity` artifact. It must not run
inference, refresh hardware receipts, tune CPU/thread/affinity defaults,
promote OpenVINO CPU, mutate route policy, expand benchmarks, touch
`low_power`, claim speedup/power/native accelerator behavior, or treat dense
SLM evidence as BitNet QK256/I2_S proof.

Keep
[#1567](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm/issues/1567)
separate as the later aggregate/session overhead-scope candidate. A future
PR under #1567 should not duplicate #1599's generic `host_overhead` bucket; it
should only add scope-specific aggregate/session overhead names or a companion
checker that keeps aggregate observations from satisfying profile
`receipt_write_ms` or `telemetry_ms` blockers by implication.

## Phase F: Rust-Native Product Surface

Wrap existing Python OpenVINO proof harnesses before replacing them:

```text
stage 0: Python proof harness, committed receipts
stage 1: Rust CLI wrapper invokes Python script with strict args
stage 2: Rust receipt validator consumes Python receipt schema
stage 3: Rust OpenVINO runtime binding / subprocess bridge
stage 4: Rust-native OpenVINO GenAI wrapper if feasible
stage 5: user-facing ask/chat/bench/server surfaces
```

Do not delete Python proof harnesses until Rust surfaces emit equivalent
receipts and pass the same validators.

## Phase G: Server and BitNet OpenVINO Research

Server readiness is exact-profile only and follows ask/chat readiness. BitNet
OpenVINO starts with static subgraph parity and does not become full BitNet
QK256 decode or speedup proof without a later spec, ADR, plan, and receipts.
