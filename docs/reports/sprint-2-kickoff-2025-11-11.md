# Sprint-2 Kickoff - BitNet-rs MVP v0.1.0

> Claim boundary: this is a historical planning report. Ready-to-execute,
> CUDA, AVX2, speedup, throughput, MVP, and performance-target wording records
> that dated planning context only. Current support, speed, backend execution,
> quality, and product-readiness claims must come from active receipts, model
> coverage, status docs, specs, and claim gates.

**Date**: November 11, 2025
**Status**: Ready to Execute
**Milestone**: MVP v0.1.0 (due 2025-12-31)

---

## Executive Summary

Repository organization complete. Sprint-2 focuses on two parallel tracks:
- **Track A (P0)**: QK256 SIMD optimization (#417) - THE critical performance blocker
- **Track B (P1)**: MVP polish (#469) - Foundation for SIMD work

**Critical Path**: Complete #469 polish (5-7 days) → Launch #417 SIMD (2-4 weeks) → MVP release

---

## Optional Enhancements

### Dependabot Grouping (Future PR)

To reduce PR noise, consider grouping related dependencies:

**File**: `.github/dependabot-enhanced.yml` (created)

**Groups added**:
- `tokio-ecosystem`: tokio*, bytes, hyper*, h2, mio
- `serde-ecosystem`: serde*
- `test-dependencies`: proptest*, criterion*, quickcheck*
- `github-actions`: actions/*, dtolnay/*, Swatinem/*, taiki-e/*

**Benefits**:
- 1 PR per group instead of N individual PRs
- Easier to review related updates together
- Lower CI cost (fewer workflow runs)

**To apply**:
```bash
mv .github/dependabot-enhanced.yml .github/dependabot.yml
git add .github/dependabot.yml
git commit -m "ci: group Dependabot updates to reduce PR noise"
git push
```

### Auto-Merge Policy (Future)

Once Dependabot runs for a few weeks and proves stable:
- Consider auto-merge for **patch** Cargo bumps only (leaf crates)
- Keep Actions manual (SHA pins already handle immutability)
- Requires enabling `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` in repo settings

---

## Watch List (Week 1)

### CI Health Monitors

1. **Receipt lane latency** (post-exclude changes)
   - Quantization matrix should skip bitnet-py/bitnet-wasm
   - Expected: <5min per job (down from 15min)

2. **Nightly guard summaries**
   - Watch for `ubuntu-latest` drift
   - Verify receipt exclude patterns work

3. **Dependabot PRs** (starting this week)
   - Confirm CI footprint acceptable
   - Review grouping effectiveness after 2-3 weeks

### Code Quality

1. **AVX2 kernel parity** (during #417 implementation)
   - Cosine similarity ≥ .99999 on all test shapes
   - No silent divergence on edge cases

2. **Memory safety** (#319 KV cache work)
   - Valgrind clean
   - No leaks in long-running inference
