=== Analysis (Median of 3 runs) ===

Performance Breakdown:
  Embedding:        26 μs    (0.026 ms)  -  0.00%
  Forward Pass:  1,865 μs  (1,865.375 ms)  - 95.61%
  Logits:           72 μs   (72.092 ms)  -  3.70%
  Sampling:        155 μs    (0.155 ms)  -  0.01%
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Total:         1,951 μs  (1,950.925 ms)

Throughput: 0.5126 tokens/second

Key Observations:
- Forward pass dominates at 95.61% of total time
- Logits computation is 3.70% overhead
- Embedding and sampling are negligible (<0.02% combined)

=== Notes ===

1. This is Phase 2 timing measurement using the optimized release binary
   with native CPU features enabled (AVX-512).

2. The ~0.5 tok/s performance is expected for I2_S format on CPU inference
   with the current implementation.

3. The forward pass bottleneck (95.61%) indicates optimization focus should
   be on the transformer computation kernels.

4. AVX-512 instructions are available but may not be fully utilized in the
   current implementation. Further SIMD optimization could improve throughput.

5. Performance is measured on WSL2, which may have slight overhead compared
   to native Linux.
