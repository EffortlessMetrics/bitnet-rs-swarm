# CI Workflow Inventory

A flat listing of GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/` and
how they map (or don't yet map) to the CI lane whitelist
(`policy/ci-lane-whitelist.toml`).

This document is human-curated; the authoritative machine-readable
view is the whitelist itself, validated by `xtask ci-lane-whitelist check`.

## Default-PR workflows

| Workflow                          | Whitelist lane(s)                                  | Notes                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `pr-plan.yml`                     | `pr-plan`                                          | Visibility-only                    |
| `ci-core.yml`                     | `ci-core-build-test`, `ci-core-clippy`, `ci-core-docs`, `bdd-grid-check` | BDD grid runs only when relevant   |
| `feature-matrix.yml`              | `feature-matrix-full-cli`, `feature-matrix-full` | Full CLI and full matrix are risk-routed; no duplicate ordinary-PR smoke |
| `compatibility.yml`               | `compatibility-msrv`, `compatibility-ffi-abi`      | MSRV path-gated; FFI label-gated   |

## Risk-gated and expensive workflows

## Backlog

The whitelist intentionally covers the highest-signal lanes first.
Workflows in the "deep / not yet whitelisted" rows above will be
added in follow-up PRs once their proof obligation, owner, and cost
are pinned down. Any lane not in the whitelist is treated as
opt-in (labels / scheduled), never required for ordinary PRs.
