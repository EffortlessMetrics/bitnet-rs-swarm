# CI Cost and Verification Policy

BitNet-rs intentionally targets CI cost per ordinary pull request far below the
default cost profile common in large agentic or infrastructure-heavy
repositories.

Our target is not "cheap because lightly tested." It is the opposite:

> We want **stronger verification** than a conventional PR workflow, but we
> want it delivered through fast, deterministic, Rust-native tests that are
> scoped to the actual risk surface of the change.

The repository style is summarized in [`docs/REPO_STYLE.md`](../REPO_STYLE.md):
BitNet-rs should operate as an evidence machine with strict defaults, owned
exceptions, static signal first, runtime proof where it pays, receipts
everywhere, and one review-fast PR at a time. CI economics are the cost-control
part of that doctrine, not a reduction in proof ambition.

At our volume, CI spend compounds quickly. A workflow that seems acceptable at
low PR volume becomes unreasonable when many human and agent-authored branches
are iterating in parallel. Cost discipline is therefore part of correctness
discipline: if verification is too expensive, people avoid running it; if it is
cheap, deterministic, and well-scoped, it becomes part of the normal
development loop.

## Routed verification rollout

The active implementation map for the sub-$0.50 ordinary-PR target lives in
[`docs/ci/routed-verification-rollout.md`](./routed-verification-rollout.md).
That document is the agent-ready rollout spec for turning CI into a routed
verification system: ordinary PRs get Linux-only crate/risk-scoped proof, while
macOS, Windows, Docker, model downloads, coverage, performance, hardware, and
other expensive proof are preserved on `main`, schedules, release/campaign
lanes, manual dispatch, or explicit labels. The companion machine-readable
queue is `policy/ci-routed-rollout.toml`.

Rollout PRs must use the PR body sections from the rollout document so every
change records default LEM before/after, lanes removed from default, preserved
verification, boundaries, and validation.

## PR burn-down write-action law

Queue burn-down has its own CI economics rule:
[PR Write-Action CI Economics](../specs/BITNET-SPEC-PR-CI-ECONOMICS.md).
The machine-readable policy is `policy/pr-ci-actions.toml`.

Closing, reopening, rebasing, pushing, retargeting, labeling, recreating, and
rerunning workflows are write actions. They can trigger CI, status churn, review
churn, or branch-protection recomputation. During PR queue recovery, do
read-only archaeology first and write only when the current disposition, merge,
or proof decision requires it.

The default rules are:

- no bulk write without explicit approval;
- no CI for archaeology;
- CI only for approved merge candidates, approved clean ports, branch refreshes
  needed for current proof, failed required-check reruns with evidence, or other
  required proof;
- close/reopen/recreate actions must satisfy the PR queue disposition law.

## Cost target

For ordinary PRs, our operating target is:

- **Preferred:** well below `$1` per PR
- **Normal Rust PR target:** materially below `$0.50`
- **Docs / tracking PR target:** pennies
- **High-risk or explicitly labeled PRs:** may use more budget, but only when
  the extra verification is tied to a real risk surface

The `$1` mark is a ceiling, not the goal.

## Timeout and cap policy

Timeouts are pathological-run guards, not budget targets. CI cost should be
controlled by routing, smaller profiles, fail-fast preflight checks, labels,
manual dispatch, schedules, and campaign lanes. Once an expensive lane is
intentionally selected, its timeout must give a healthy run enough room to
produce a result.

Cutting a job off after it has already spent most of its expected runtime is
usually the worst outcome: the compute has been spent, no receipt or test result
is produced, and the next attempt repeats the same cost. Treat that as a policy
failure unless the timeout exposed a real hang or runaway path.

Long hardware, model, SLM, coverage, fuzz, and release lanes should therefore
follow this order:

- reject irrelevant work before it starts through CI routing,
- fail fast on missing prerequisites before downloads, builds, or model runs,
- choose a smaller bounded profile when the full profile is too expensive,
- size the selected job cap from recent successful runtimes with cushion,
- keep aggregator polling deadlines at least as long as the healthy upstream
  lane they are waiting on.

If the selected lane is too expensive to let finish, it should not be selected
for that event. It should move to a label, schedule, manual dispatch, release
gate, or campaign receipt lane instead of using a near-completion timeout as a
cost control.

The machine-readable policy lives in `policy/ci-budget.toml`. Long selected
lanes should use the larger of the configured minimum completion cushions:

```text
minimum_completion_cushion_percent = 20
minimum_completion_cushion_minutes = 10
```

Timeout and cancellation records should remain visible in actuals reporting as
cap failures, but they should not enter healthy-runtime percentile samples. A
cancelled or timed-out job did not produce the receipt, test result, or cache
state that the selected lane was supposed to buy.

Short, cheap PR validators may use PR-only cancellation when their result is
only useful for the newest commit:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
```

Long selected lanes should not use cancellation as a cost control, including
when they are selected by a PR label such as `coverage`, `crossval`,
`property-tests`, `receipts`, or `full-ci`. They should reject irrelevant events
before the job starts, then use:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

This lets started runs produce the receipt, cache state, or failure evidence
that the lane was selected to buy. GitHub may still collapse pending queued runs
for the same concurrency group before they start; the policy boundary is that
started long jobs should finish unless they exceed their explicit timeout or hit
a real failure. Workflows that have no PR trigger, such as cache warmers, should
normally use `cancel-in-progress: false` unless the workflow is explicitly
designed to discard partial work.

### Selected hardware and model lanes

Hardware/model lanes such as the M3 MacBook Air work need an extra distinction:
ordinary PR CI should not select live downloads, dense SLM timing, or large
artifact sweeps by default, but an explicitly selected hardware lane should be
allowed to finish. Ending it shortly before receipt emission pays nearly the
full cost while preserving none of the evidence.

Selected long lanes should therefore encode:

- preflight gates before downloads, builds, or model execution,
- one active large artifact per constrained local host unless a storage audit
  says otherwise,
- phase artifact upload after profile, download, hash, validation, and receipt
  steps,
- timeout caps derived from successful completed runs plus cushion,
- PR-gate or aggregator waits that are longer than the upstream job cap,
- timeout and cancellation actuals recorded separately from healthy runtime
  samples.

If that selected profile is too expensive to let finish, route it to a smaller
profile, explicit label, manual dispatch, schedule, release gate, or campaign
receipt lane before it starts. Do not use a near-completion timeout as the
budget mechanism.

### Lean GitHub-hosted fallback

The normal route remains self-hosted. The routed Rust-small workflow has one
explicitly authorized hosted escape hatch for a missing self-hosted fleet:

- the router must find no trusted online `cx43`/`cx53` runner;
- the PR must carry `allow-github-hosted`, `full-ci`, or `ci-budget-ack`, or
  workflow dispatch must set `allow_github_hosted=true`;
- `ci-budget-override` is a separate recovery escape hatch: it may select the
  same hosted proof when a runner is online but known to be unhealthy;
- the fallback is same-repository only and runs on pinned `ubuntu-22.04`;
- it runs only the lean Rust-small package/lib-test proof, with no Docker,
  models, credentials, GPU, hardware, coverage, fuzz, performance, or full
  feature matrix;
- a busy-but-online self-hosted pool still queues and never spills to hosted
  unless `ci-budget-override` explicitly selects the bounded recovery path.

This fallback is continuity evidence, not a silent hosted replacement for
self-hosted or hardware proof. Its normalized result remains
`BitNet Rust Small Result`; conditional implementation jobs may be skipped by
design.

The staged M3 Air dense SLM workflow is the reference Apple MacBook pattern:

```text
.github/workflows/apple-m3-air-dense-slm.yml
```

It is manual-only, defaults to a no-run staged message, requires an explicit
`enable_run=true` dispatch for live hardware, uses `cancel-in-progress: false`,
checks disk before model fetch, writes preflight and host-context artifacts, and
uploads the receipt directory with `if: always()`. Future M3 Air model, artifact,
or timing lanes should either reuse that pattern or explain why the selected
lane can safely discard partial work.

The shared macOS Apple Silicon workflow follows the same cancellation rule only
after Apple proof is selected. On pull requests, a cheap Linux routing job runs
first; the `macos-14` jobs start only for labels `macos`, `apple-silicon`,
`metal`, or `full-ci`, or for Mac/Metal-specific paths. Ordinary Rust PRs keep
the branch-protection-compatible summary check, but they do not launch Apple
Silicon runners. Once a selected macOS job starts, `cancel-in-progress: false`
keeps platform-specific compile and test evidence from being thrown away by a
later push after runner time has already been spent.

## Why the budget target is aggressive

Our CI budget target is intentionally aggressive — but **not because we want
less verification**.

We believe the opposite. Agentic development requires *more* verification than
traditional software development, and likely more verification than most
current agentic repositories are doing today. More generated branches, more
rapid iteration, more integration edges, and more repeated PR attempts all
increase the need for automated proof. Review alone does not scale to that
volume.

OpenClaw is a useful benchmark **not because we think they are wrong to spend
heavily on verification**, but because their published cost curve shows what
happens when verification demand rises faster than verification efficiency.
They published a Blacksmith runner bill of roughly `$511k`; using commit
volume since February as the denominator, that maps directionally to about
`$20 per commit` on Blacksmith runners alone. Because OpenClaw appears to
squash-merge PRs, commit cost is a reasonable proxy for per-PR cost — though
the figure should be treated as **directional rather than exact**.

That number is not evidence that OpenClaw is doing CI wrong. It is evidence
that **verification demand is rising faster than verification efficiency**.
The lesson is not "verify less." The lesson is that serious agentic
workflows need a better verification cost model. The question is not
verification vs. cost. The question is:

```text
expensive broad verification
   vs.
cheap, scoped, high-frequency verification
```

BitNet-rs is targeting a **different verification economics model**, not less
verification:

- ordinary PRs should stay well below `$1`,
- normal Rust PRs should usually land well below `$0.50`,
- docs / tracking PRs should cost pennies,
- expensive lanes should run when they are relevant, not by default,
- high-cost validation should require explicit labels, main-branch execution,
  nightly execution, release gates, or campaign gates.

PR-time fuzz target builds follow that routing rule: they run for changes to
the fuzz harness, Rust crates, lockfiles, toolchain, Cargo configuration, or
the fuzz workflow itself. Docs / tracking-only PRs use the docs and campaign
tracker lanes instead of spending CI minutes compiling fuzz targets that
cannot be affected by the diff.

Performance Baseline Tracking follows the same rule. Pull requests run only a
cheap Linux route job unless `performance`, `perf`, or `full-ci` is present.
The former default PR `cargo check --workspace --features cpu` smoke now runs
only when performance tracking is selected, while the comprehensive benchmark
matrix remains on schedule and manual dispatch.

Test Telemetry is advisory observability, not a merge gate. Ordinary PRs run
only its cheap route job; nextest/JUnit and slow-test summaries run on `main`,
manual dispatch, or labels `test-telemetry`, `slow-tests`, and `full-ci`.

MSRV compatibility is global-risk proof. Ordinary leaf implementation PRs run
only the compatibility route job; the MSRV checks run for manifest, lockfile,
toolchain, `.cargo`, public API, FFI, release/package surfaces, `main`, manual
dispatch, or labels `msrv`, `compatibility`, and `full-ci`.

The goal is not to spend less by testing less. **The goal is to spend less on
unrelated work so we can afford more verification where the change actually
creates risk.**

## Why Rust and ripr matter

A major reason BitNet-rs is written in Rust is that Rust changes the cost
curve of verification.

Rust lets us push a large share of correctness checking into fast,
deterministic, local validation:

- type and ownership checks at compile time,
- crate-local unit tests,
- feature-gated compile checks,
- small oracle tests,
- bounded property tests,
- deterministic receipt and schema tests,
- precise package and dependency selection.

That means we can run deep checks without needing every ordinary PR to
download models, build external C++ references, start Docker images,
provision macOS runners, or touch live hardware.

### ripr shifts mutation signal left

The CI design principles in this document are adapted from the
[ripr](https://github.com/EffortlessMetrics/ripr) project, which we also use
as tooling. ripr is one of the main reasons this CI strategy is
economically viable. It is **not** generic CI routing.

Coverage tells us code executed. Traditional mutation testing tells us
whether tests fail when a concrete mutant is run. Both are useful, but they
sit at different points on the cost curve:

```text
coverage:
  cheap, but often too weak as an oracle signal
ripr:
  static mutation-exposure signal
mutation testing:
  strong runtime confirmation, but expensive
```

`ripr` is static mutation-exposure analysis. It catches much of the same signal
mutation testing catches -- weak test/oracle exposure -- but earlier and
cheaper, because it runs statically and can run per PR.

The PR-time question it answers is:

> For the behavior changed in this diff, do the current tests appear to
> contain a discriminator that would notice if that behavior were wrong?

That is exactly the kind of signal agentic development needs: fast, local,
targeted, and cheap enough to run while a PR is still being drafted.

`ripr` does **not** run mutants, does **not** report `killed` / `survived`
outcomes, and does **not** replace execution-backed mutation testing. It
shifts mutation signal left. Mutation testing remains the runtime empirical
backstop, especially for targeted risk PRs, nightly, and release readiness.

### The verification ladder

| Signal                                 |        Cost | Use                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------: | ---------------------------------------- |
| `cargo check` / clippy                 |         low | type / lint correctness                  |
| unit / oracle tests                    |         low | deterministic behavior proof             |
| `ripr`                                 |  low-medium | static mutation-exposure signal |
| property tests                         |      medium | bounded-input confidence                 |
| coverage                               | medium-high | execution surface                        |
| mutation testing                       |        high | runtime adequacy confirmation            |
| crossval / hardware / model validation |        high | external parity and platform proof       |

The strategic claim is:

```text
Rust makes correctness checks fast.
ripr makes oracle gaps visible early.
LEM budgeting makes verification economics explicit.
CI routing spends expensive lanes only where they buy signal.
```

Together, they let us **increase** verification density without letting CI
spend scale linearly with PR volume. The goal is more proof per CI minute —
enough verification for the agentic age, paid for by changing the cost curve
of verification.

## Coverage reporting (Codecov)

Coverage is one signal on the verification ladder: it measures **execution
surface**, not test adequacy or model quality.

### What coverage answers

Coverage tells us: *Did tests exercise this Rust code?*

It does **not** tell us:

- whether tests would catch the wrong behavior (see `ripr`, property tests)
- whether the inference engine produces correct output (see crossval, hardware validation)
- whether GPU backends are correct (see GPU scaffolding status in README)
- whether model predictions are sound (see model validation in `docs/howto/`)

### Coverage in BitNet-rs

Coverage runs are **gated by label or main branch**:

- **PR runs:** only when explicitly labeled `coverage` or `full-ci`
- **Main runs:** automatic after every merge (cost: ~45 LEM, included in
  release validation)
- **Flag:** `rust-cpu` — CPU path execution surface only
- **Threshold policy:** currently informational; will ratchet after baseline
  collection

Coverage artifacts (`coverage.json`, `coverage.txt`, `lcov.info`, `coverage-report`) are stored on every run, enabling trend analysis and per-crate surface inspection.

### Codecov configuration

Codecov integration is configured in `codecov.yml` with:

- **Project status:** tracks overall coverage %
- **Patch status:** tracks changes in PR diffs
- **Comments:** disabled — the GitHub check and Codecov dashboard are the
  primary signals
- **Flags:** scoped to `rust-cpu` for now; GPU flags deferred until backend
  validation is real

### Coverage is not

Coverage is explicitly **not** responsible for:

- CUDA, Metal, OpenCL, ROCm validation (GPU backends are still scaffold)
- model quality or inference correctness (see crossval, hardware receipts)
- test design adequacy (see `ripr` and property tests)
- production inference performance (see hardware validation, runtime receipts)

### Future: baseline and ratchet

After 10–20 runs with real project coverage, we will review:

1. Coverage % distribution across crate types
2. Lowest-covered core paths
3. Runtime cost and flake rate
4. Whether `--ignore-run-fail` is masking relevant failures

Then we will decide whether to tighten thresholds and move from informational
to enforced status. Decisions will be based on observed data, not aspiration.

## Why verification needs to increase

Agentic development changes the shape of risk.

More code can be produced more quickly, but that means more integration edges,
more generated changes, more repeated PR attempts, and more cases where review
alone is not enough. The answer is not to trust less or slow everything down
manually. The answer is to make verification cheaper, sharper, and harder to
bypass.

For BitNet-rs, that means ordinary PRs should run tests that are:

- deterministic,
- local,
- Rust-native,
- model-free,
- hardware-free,
- scoped to the changed crates and their dependents,
- able to catch real regressions before merge.

Expensive validation still matters, but it belongs on the right lanes: main,
nightly, release, campaign, hardware, or explicit labels such as `full-ci`,
`gpu-ci`, `crossval`, `coverage`, or `model-validation`.

## Linux-equivalent minutes (LEM)

We track CI in **Linux-equivalent minutes** because raw wall-clock minutes
hide runner cost. A 10-minute macOS job and a 10-minute Linux job are not
economically equivalent.

LEM gives us one planning unit:

```text
LEM = wall_minutes × runner_multiplier
```

GitHub-hosted runner multipliers (rough planning placeholders):

| Runner            | Multiplier |
| ----------------- | ---------: |
| Linux             |        1.0 |
| Linux + GHA cache |        1.0 |
| GPU Docker (gha)  |       ~6.0 |
| macOS-14 (M1)     |       10.0 |
| Windows           |        2.0 |

Use cases for LEM:

1. **Forecast** PR cost before the PR runs (see `.github/workflows/pr-plan.yml`).
2. **Compare** optional lanes fairly when deciding what to gate behind labels.
3. **Prevent** expensive labels from silently turning ordinary PRs into
   high-cost validation runs.
4. **Calibrate** budgets against observed spend before introducing hard
   budget enforcement.

We deliberately start with LEM **visibility** rather than LEM **enforcement**.
The current repo-level evidence does not yet provide durable enough timing,
queue, cache-hit, failure-rate, flake, and MTTR data to manage CI as a
complete operating system. The path forward is: collect that data, tighten
the default PR lane, move exhaustive lanes to main/nightly/labels, and only
then enforce learned budgets with guardrails.

## CI lane policy

Ordinary PR CI should answer:

> Did this change plausibly break the changed crate, its direct dependents,
> or the canonical CPU path?

It should not answer every question the project can ask.

Broader validation is still required, but it is routed:

| Lane           | Purpose                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Ordinary PR    | Fast, scoped correctness gate                 |
| Main           | Broader integration confidence                |
| Nightly        | Exhaustive / expensive validation             |
| Labeled PR     | Explicit high-risk or campaign validation     |
| Hardware lane  | Live backend and device proof                 |
| Release lane   | Final compatibility, coverage, audit surface  |

This keeps verification strong without making every PR pay for every lens.

## What this does not mean

This policy does **not** mean:

- skipping tests because they are inconvenient,
- hiding failures in non-blocking jobs,
- relying only on happy-path smoke tests,
- avoiding cross-validation,
- avoiding coverage,
- avoiding hardware validation.

It means each check must run where it provides the most value for its cost.

A PR that touches QK256 layout should run QK256 layout fixtures, scalar oracle
tests, and low-case property checks. It should not automatically build every
GPU Docker image.

A tokenizer PR should run tokenizer fixtures. It should not install large
Python stacks or fetch external models unless explicitly requested.

A docs-only PR should run docs and tracking checks. It should not compile the
Rust workspace.

CI Core treats no-Rust-input PRs as a first-class fast path. When the diff is
limited to docs, campaign/tracker metadata, hardware receipts, or policy docs,
CI Core keeps emitting the required `CI Core Success` check without running Rust
build, test, clippy, rustdoc, or `xtask` jobs. Tracker/campaign-only changes are
delegated to the dedicated Campaign Tracker workflow for campaign doctor and
generated-dashboard freshness. Hardware receipt-only changes run changed-receipt
JSON syntax checks inside CI Core. Pure docs and policy-docs changes rely on the
dedicated docs, markdown, link, policy, and PR Gate lanes.

For Rust-input PRs, CI Core uses `ci-plan.json` package selection for the
Linux build/test surface. The selected package set is the union of changed
workspace packages, direct dependents from `cargo metadata`, and risk-pack
canaries. Manifest, toolchain, and shared-foundation changes still force the
full core sweep because their blast radius is intentionally broader than a
single package edge.

Feature Matrix follows the same routing rule. Ordinary Rust PRs run the
canonical `no-features` and `cpu` workspace compile checks. The heavier
`cpu+full-cli` compile smoke runs only for CLI, server, validation,
model-cache, manifest, lockfile, toolchain, or `.cargo` changes, or when a PR
is explicitly labeled `full-cli`. The exhaustive feature matrix remains a deep
lane for `feature-matrix`, `full-ci`, `main`, and manual dispatch.

## Operating metric

We optimize for:

```text
proof per CI minute
```

A useful CI minute either:

1. blocks a likely bad merge,
2. proves a meaningful invariant,
3. narrows the cause of a failure,
4. updates a durable signal such as timing, flake, coverage, or compatibility
   state.

CI minutes spent on duplicated checks, no-op jobs, broad unrelated workflows,
unnecessary model downloads, or non-blocking confirmation lanes are waste.

Timeouts are cost guardrails, not budget targets. A timeout should catch
runaway or wedged jobs with enough diagnostic output to act on. It should not
regularly fire just before a valid lane completes, because that burns nearly
the full runner budget while discarding the proof. When a lane repeatedly times
out after useful work has passed, either split the lane, reduce its scope, or
raise the cap to a value that lets the lane finish with normal variance.

The expected result is a CI system that is **cheaper than conventional broad
PR validation, but stronger where it matters**.

## CI is part of the architecture

CI is not a billing concern bolted on after the system is built. We treat
cost, latency, determinism, and proof strength as design constraints, not
after-the-fact billing concerns. The test rig is part of the machine.
