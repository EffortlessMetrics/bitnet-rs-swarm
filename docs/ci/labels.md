# CI Labels Reference

BitNet-rs uses GitHub labels to selectively trigger heavy CI workflows. This keeps fast feedback for most PRs while ensuring comprehensive validation when needed.

> **Cost discipline:** these labels are not convenience toggles. They are
> explicit spend and verification decisions. The default PR lane is designed
> to stay well below `$1` per PR — preferably far below — while still running
> strong Rust-native tests scoped to the changed crates and risk packs. See
> [CI Cost and Verification Policy](./cost-and-verification-policy.md) for
> the rationale.

## Label-Gated Workflows

These workflows only run when their corresponding label is applied to a PR:

### `coverage`

**Triggers**: Code coverage analysis
**When to use**: For changes to core inference, quantization, or kernel code
**CI Impact**: ~5-10 minutes; generates coverage reports with lcov/grcov

**Examples**:
- Changes to `bitnet-inference` or `bitnet-quantization`
- New kernel implementations in `bitnet-kernels`
- Major refactoring of core logic

**Note**: Coverage on `main` runs on every push with strict thresholds (≥70% required).

---

### `receipts`

**Triggers**: CPU receipt verification gates (Model Gates workflow)
**When to use**: For changes affecting inference compute paths or quantization algorithms
**CI Impact**: ~3-5 minutes; validates receipt schema and honest compute requirements

**Examples**:
- Changes to inference engine (`bitnet-inference`)
- Quantization algorithm modifications
- Receipt generation or validation logic

**Validation Gates**:
- `compute_path` must be `"real"` (not `"mocked"`)
- Non-empty `kernels` array with valid kernel IDs
- Schema v1.0.0 compliance
- Kernel ID hygiene (length ≤128, count ≤10K)

**Note**: On `main` and on **scheduled** nightly runs, receipt gates run strictly (blocking merge).

---

### `framework`

**Triggers**: Full integration test suite
**When to use**: For major architectural changes or cross-cutting concerns
**CI Impact**: ~10-15 minutes; runs complete test matrix across all crates

**Examples**:
- Changes to workspace structure
- FFI bridge modifications
- End-to-end integration scenarios
- Major refactoring affecting multiple crates

---

### `gpu`

**Triggers**: GPU-specific tests with CUDA runtime
**When to use**: For changes to GPU kernels, CUDA code, or device selection logic
**CI Impact**: ~8-12 minutes; requires self-hosted GPU runner (if available)

**Examples**:
- CUDA kernel implementations
- GPU quantization/dequantization
- Device detection or fallback logic
- Mixed precision (FP16/BF16) operations

**Note**: Requires CUDA 12.0+ toolkit and compatible GPU hardware.

---

### `quant`

**Triggers**: Quantization matrix testing (multiple quantization formats)
**When to use**: For changes to quantization algorithms or multi-format support
**CI Impact**: ~6-10 minutes; validates I2_S, TL1, TL2, QK256 formats

**Examples**:
- New quantization format implementations
- Changes to quantization kernels
- Flavor detection logic
- Cross-validation with C++ reference

---

### `crossval`

**Triggers**: Cross-validation determinism checks against C++ reference
**When to use**: For changes affecting inference results or numerical parity
**CI Impact**: ~8-12 minutes; requires BitNet.cpp setup and per-token validation

**Examples**:
- Inference engine modifications
- Quantization algorithm changes
- Numerical accuracy concerns
- Token generation logic

**Requirements**:
- `BITNET_CPP_DIR` configured
- C++ reference libraries available
- Deterministic inference enabled

**Validation**:
- Cosine similarity ≥0.999 threshold
- Per-token logits comparison
- Rust vs C++ parity

---

### `perf`

**Triggers**: Performance regression gates
**When to use**: For changes that could impact throughput or latency
**CI Impact**: ~10-15 minutes; runs benchmarks and compares against baselines

**Examples**:
- Kernel optimizations
- SIMD intrinsics
- Memory layout changes
- Critical path modifications

**Baselines**: Stored in `docs/baselines/` with datestamped filenames.

---

### `lut`

**Triggers**: TL-LUT (table lookup) stress testing
**When to use**: For changes to TL1/TL2 quantization or lookup table logic
**CI Impact**: ~5-8 minutes; validates lookup table implementations

**Examples**:
- TL1/TL2 quantization changes
- Lookup table generation
- Device-aware LUT selection (ARM NEON / x86 AVX)

---

## Always-Run Workflows

These workflows run on every PR and on `main` (Linux runners only):

### Core CI (`ci-core.yml`)

**Required checks**:
1. **Build & Test (self-hosted linux x64)** - Workspace compilation and test suite
2. **Clippy** - Lint checks with `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`
3. **Documentation** - Documentation build (`cargo doc --no-deps`)
4. **CI Core Success** - Status rollup for branch protection

**Runs on**: All PRs and on `main`
**Timeout**: 30 minutes global
**Features**: Uses `--locked` for determinism, runs with `cpu` features by default
**Notes**: All jobs run on self-hosted Linux. Clippy job aligns environment with Build & Test job for consistent warning detection.

---

### Link Checking (`link-check.yml`)

**Triggers**: Weekly schedule, manually dispatchable
**Tool**: `lychee` for broken link detection
**Scope**: Markdown files in docs/, README.md, CLAUDE.md

---

## Informational Workflows

These workflows provide feedback but don't block merges:

### Security checks

**Security & license audit**: PR-time audit runs as **Security and License Audit** job in `.github/workflows/compatibility.yml` (informational on PRs). Nightly/`main` security scan runs as **Security check** in `.github/workflows/security.yml` (required on `main`).

**Security Guard**: `Security Guard` job in `.github/workflows/validation.yml` flags banned correction flags (currently informational; will be made required in v0.2).

---

### Typos (`ci-typos.yml`)

**Triggers**: All PRs
**Purpose**: Spell checking with `typos` tool
**Current**: Informational only

---

## Label Usage Guidelines

### For Contributors

**Default behavior**: Don't add any labels unless you're changing core paths.

**Add labels proactively if**:
- You're modifying inference, quantization, or kernels → `receipts`, `quant`
- You're touching GPU code → `gpu`
- You want coverage feedback → `coverage`
- You're concerned about performance → `perf`

**Ask maintainers to add labels if**:
- You're unsure which labels apply
- You want comprehensive validation before merge
- You're making architectural changes → `framework`

### For Maintainers

**Label PRs based on changed paths**:

```bash
# Inference/quantization changes
gh pr edit <PR> --add-label receipts,quant

# GPU kernel work
gh pr edit <PR> --add-label gpu

# Cross-cutting architectural changes
gh pr edit <PR> --add-label framework,coverage

# Performance optimization
gh pr edit <PR> --add-label perf

# TL-LUT quantization
gh pr edit <PR> --add-label lut
```

**Require heavy checks before merge**:
- Apply relevant labels
- Wait for all label-gated checks to complete
- Review generated artifacts (receipts, coverage reports, benchmarks)

## Routed verification labels

The routed CI rollout uses labels to keep expensive proof available without
putting that proof on every ordinary PR. These labels are part of the rollout
contract documented in [`routed-verification-rollout.md`](./routed-verification-rollout.md)
and mirrored in `policy/ci-routed-rollout.toml`.

| Label | Authorizes | Default PR impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `full-ci` | All relevant expensive/deep lanes for the touched risk surface. | Explicitly opts out of the ordinary budget target. |
| `ci-budget-ack` | Acknowledges a high estimated LEM plan once budget guard enforcement exists. | Allows high-but-bounded plans that are otherwise warned. |
| `ci-budget-override` | Overrides the hard budget guard once enforcement exists. | Requires explicit maintainer intent. |
| `macos` | Apple platform proof. | Runs macOS lanes only by label/main/manual/path-specific routing. |
| `apple-silicon` | Apple Silicon CPU/NEON proof. | Runs Apple Silicon lanes only by label/main/manual/path-specific routing. |
| `metal` | Metal compile/proof. | Runs Metal proof for Metal paths or explicit label. |
| `performance` / `perf` | Performance baseline tracking. | Runs performance lane outside ordinary PR defaults. |
| `test-telemetry` / `slow-tests` | JUnit and slow-test telemetry. | Runs advisory telemetry outside ordinary PR defaults. |
| `msrv` / `compatibility` | MSRV compatibility proof. | Runs MSRV for explicit compatibility concern or global-risk paths. |
| `full-cli` | Targeted full CLI feature smoke. | Runs `cpu+full-cli` without selecting the exhaustive feature matrix. |
| `feature-matrix` | Expanded feature-matrix proof. | Runs the full feature matrix on a PR; ordinary PRs do not run a duplicate feature smoke. |
| `gpu-ci` | GPU native compile proof. | Runs GPU compile lanes for GPU risk only. |
| `coverage` | Codecov/coverage evidence with `rust-cpu` flag. | Runs coverage outside ordinary PR defaults. |

The shared Apple Silicon workflow still emits a cheap Linux route/summary check
on pull requests so existing branch protection does not see a missing check.
Those control jobs do not start self-hosted macOS runners. Applying `macos`,
`apple-silicon`, `metal`, or `full-ci` selects the expensive Apple jobs; main,
manual, merge-queue, and Mac/Metal-path changes still preserve Apple proof.

Performance Baseline Tracking uses the same selected-lane shape. Ordinary PRs
only run its cheap route job. Applying `performance`, `perf`, or `full-ci`
selects the historical workspace smoke; the full benchmark matrix remains
scheduled/manual evidence unless a later rollout explicitly promotes PR
benchmark selection.

Test Telemetry also stays selected-only. Ordinary PRs only run its route job;
`test-telemetry`, `slow-tests`, or `full-ci` runs the nextest/JUnit lane for
PR observability, while `main` and manual dispatch keep the same summaries.

MSRV compatibility follows risk routing. Ordinary leaf implementation PRs only
run the compatibility route job; `msrv`, `compatibility`, or `full-ci` selects
MSRV checks, and manifest/toolchain/public API/release-package paths select the
same proof automatically.
