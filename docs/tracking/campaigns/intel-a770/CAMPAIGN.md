# Intel Arc A770 Campaign

Campaign ID: `intel-a770`

Status: active

## Objective

Make the Intel Arc A770 a receipt-backed OpenCL-first BitNet acceleration lane. OpenVINO GPU is a reference lane and must not be used as native OpenCL proof. Uncommitted transcript evidence cannot promote committed A770 claims.

## End State

- A770 backend identity is distinct from generic OpenCL, Intel NPU, Arc 140V, CUDA, and CPU fallback.
- Tracker, route matrix, kernel matrix, model contract, and claim ledger agree on the committed proof level.
- Runtime probe records OpenCL, Level Zero, OpenVINO GPU, PCI, VRAM, ReBAR, and render-node facts.
- Tiny OpenCL smoke executes with fallback=false.
- CPU/OpenCL parity exists for one kernel or subgraph.
- Receipts preserve selected device identity before performance claims.

## Hard Constraints

- OpenCL-first for native A770 proof.
- Uncommitted transcript evidence cannot promote A770 claims.
- OpenVINO GPU is reference only.
- Generic OpenCL and Arc 140V proof cannot count as A770 proof.
- CPU fallback cannot count as A770 execution.
- Performance claims require driver, PCIe, ReBAR, VRAM, power, and thermal context.

| A770-018 | merged | Record the first committed live five-case A770 OpenCL answer-corpus diagnostic receipt for the official BitNet 2B I2_S model, keeping reference parity, broad answer quality, residency, speed, and trusted-partial claims closed. |

| A770-020 | merged | Record same-box AMD 5700X AVX2 CPU and Intel A770 OpenCL answer-corpus receipts with one-step top-k logits, compare them with the answer-parity tool, and preserve the first CPU/A770 logits divergence without claiming exact parity. |
| A770-021 | merged | Add a compact logits top-k frontier to the CPU/A770 answer-parity receipt, separating same-output top-k drift from generated-output drift without changing runtime math or promoting parity. |

## Current Claim Boundary

Committed A770 OpenCL proof remains diagnostic. The campaign does not currently claim full BitNet inference, trusted partial acceleration, performance speedup, support-op residency, full device residency, dense SLM support, Gemma support, or native OpenCL proof from OpenVINO GPU. The selected-device QK256 scaled fixture, A770-011 dispatch candidate, A770-012 strict dispatch receipt, A770-013 CLI route receipt scaffold, A770-014 model-contract route alignment, A770-015 answer-corpus route contract, A770-016 answer-corpus proof-route binding, A770-017 OpenCL runtime detection alignment, A770-018 live five-case answer-corpus diagnostic receipt, A770-019 OpenCL runtime-probe build fix, A770-020 CPU/A770 answer-parity diagnostic, A770-021 logits top-k frontier, A770-022 multi-step generated-output frontier, A770-023 first-mismatch logit-margin frontier, A770-024 seeded answer-readiness corpus contract, A770-025 live seeded answer-readiness diagnostic, A770-026 answer-readiness failure-frontier classification, A770-027 focused readiness divergence logit-context diagnostic, A770-028 normalized scoring repair, A770-029 prompt-contract repair, A770-030 focused summary logit-context diagnostic, A770-031 first-mismatch argmax-source frontier, A770-032 internal logit-source context, A770-033 hidden-state source frontier, and A770-034 model-forward source frontier do not prove GPU-resident activation quantization, broad answer quality, selected attention residency, resident KV, reference parity, strict A770 answer readiness, CPU/A770 answer parity, or full BitNet inference.

## Review Policy

A770 runtime PRs are non-stackable. Do not combine A770 with Intel NPU, Arc 140V, or CPU proof changes unless the campaign manifest explicitly allows it.
