## Purpose

This document defines how selected work moves from
`EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm` to the public source-of-truth and release
repository, `EffortlessMetrics/BitNet-rs`.

During migration, swarm owns high-throughput same-repo execution and proof
work. `BitNet-rs` remains the public source-of-truth until an explicit
sync/cutover says otherwise, and it owns release history, tags, crates.io
publication, release notes, stable release branches, package metadata, and
release-blocking hotfixes.

Swarm-only commits do not become public-release authority until a promotion or
sync PR names the included work, proof inputs, claim boundaries, and excluded
work.

Promotion is therefore a reviewable packeted handoff, not a branch drift repair.
Do not promote by copying files, cherry-picking undocumented branch tips, or
opening a vague "sync swarm" PR without source-impact and claim-boundary
metadata.

Source-to-swarm syncs are the opposite direction from release promotion. They
keep `bitnet-rs-swarm` current with public source while source remains
canonical. They do not make swarm the release repo, do not move publish or
signing authority, and do not promote swarm-only evidence back to source.

## History Repair Baseline

The one-time swarm history repair is recorded in:

```text
docs/development/SWARM_HISTORY_REPAIR.md
```

That closeout records the real import merge, imported source SHA, old swarm
ancestor, current source reachability proof, release-workflow guard boundary,
and open swarm PR snapshot at repair closeout.

Future promotions and syncs must preserve that repaired graph. Do not reset
swarm main, squash history imports, or copy source files as a single content
commit to make the repositories appear fresh.

Do not transform a source checkout into a swarm checkout, or a swarm checkout
into a source checkout, by hard reset, branch replacement, or tree-copy import.
Use side-by-side clones and history-preserving sync or promotion branches.

The active source/swarm boundary policy is recorded in:

```text
policy/repo-boundary.toml
```

Promotion packets should use that ledger for the canonical repository roles,
forbidden history operations, release-workflow boundary, and required promotion
inputs.

The latest source-to-swarm sync checkpoint is also recorded in
`docs/development/SWARM_HISTORY_REPAIR.md`. Use it to identify the last known
source commit reachable from swarm before preparing another sync or promotion.
Always verify live refs; the checkpoint is evidence, not a substitute for
current ancestry checks.

## Merge Method

Promotion is a repository-boundary operation. It must preserve swarm ancestry in
the public source repo.

Do not squash swarm-to-source promotion PRs. A promotion must land by regular
merge commit or by an explicitly approved fast-forward/direct update that keeps
the promoted swarm commits reachable from `BitNet-rs/main`.

Recommended branch shape:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EffortlessMetrics/BitNet-rs.git bitnet-rs-promote
cd bitnet-rs-promote
git remote add swarm git@github.com:EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm.git
git fetch origin --prune
git fetch swarm --prune
git switch -c promote/swarm-YYYY-MM-DD origin/main
git merge --no-ff swarm/main -m "promote: merge bitnet-rs-swarm through <swarm_sha>"
```

This clone is separate from the active swarm checkout. Machines should keep the
source and swarm clones side by side so release/publish work and swarm execution
work cannot accidentally reuse the wrong remote.

The source repo may either temporarily/permanently allow merge commits for
`promote:swarm-to-source` PRs, or an admin may perform a non-force
fast-forward/direct update after proof. Force-push is not an accepted promotion
method.

## Promotion Inputs

Before opening a release-promotion PR against `BitNet-rs`, prepare:

```text
source_repo = EffortlessMetrics/bitnet-rs-swarm
source_commit = <swarm main sha>
source_prs = [<included swarm PR numbers>]
release_target = patch | minor | prerelease
version = <x.y.z or prerelease version>
changelog = <summary or changelog path>
proof_pack = <receipt or manifest path>
excluded_work = <known swarm work intentionally not promoted>
```

The source commit should be on swarm `main` unless the release manager has
approved a narrower hotfix source.

## Promotion Packet

A promotion packet is required before opening a source-repo promotion PR. It can
live under `target/promotion/` for a dry run, or under a committed
`docs/release/promotion-packets/` path when the promotion itself needs a durable
review artifact.

Generate the first draft from the swarm checkout with:

```bash
cargo run --locked -p xtask --no-default-features -- promote-to-source \
  --from <last-source-sync-or-promotion-sha> \
  --to HEAD \
  --out target/promotion/packet.md
```

The generator is a conservative local classifier. It records the range,
changed files, touched crates, campaign and policy surfaces, generated dashboard
touches, release-sensitive workflow touches, and placeholder proof/receipt
sections. The generated packet is not release approval; fill in proof commands,
receipts, excluded work, and claim boundaries before opening a source PR.

Use this shape:

```text
Promotion id:
Source repo:
Target repo:
Swarm range:
Included swarm PRs:
Included swarm SHAs:
Source impact:
Changed files:
Touched crates:
Campaigns touched:
Policy files touched:
Generated dashboard status:
Proof commands:
Receipts:
Claim boundary:
What this does not claim:
Release/publish/signing impact:
Excluded swarm work:
Rollback:
```

The packet should be conservative. If it cannot prove that a hardware, model,
quality, speed, residency, server, or release claim is allowed, the packet must
say that the claim is not promoted.

## Promotion PR Body

The `BitNet-rs` promotion PR should include:

- merge method: regular merge commit or approved fast-forward/direct update;
- source swarm commit;
- included swarm PRs;
- release target and version;
- changelog summary;
- proof manifest or receipt pack;
- package/publish checks;
- excluded swarm work;
- explicit claim boundary.

It should link the promotion packet and summarize only the parts that matter
for source review.

For hardware, model, quality, performance, or residency claims, include the
exact receipt paths and claim ledgers that allow the claim. If a receipt is
missing, leave the claim out.

## Release Checks

Release PRs run package and publish gates instead of re-running every swarm
hardware lane by default.

Expected checks:

```text
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo package --workspace --allow-dirty
cargo publish --dry-run, when applicable
```

If a command cannot run, record why, substitute evidence if available, and
whether the gap blocks release.

## Claim Boundary

Do not broaden claims during promotion.

The release PR must preserve:

- selected backend and device identity for hardware claims;
- model and tokenizer identity for model claims;
- fallback status;
- behavior or quality gate;
- benchmark profile for performance claims;
- explicit not-claims;
- excluded work.

Diagnostic-only swarm receipts remain diagnostic unless the promotion proof pack
makes them claim-grade.

## Source-Owned Surfaces

Do not casually overwrite source-owned release surfaces during promotion:

| File type | Promotion handling |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime/code/docs/specs/tests | Promote when included in the promotion scope. |
| Receipts intended for source | Promote when policy-compliant and claim-bounded. |
| Swarm-only CI | Usually exclude. |
| Swarm authority docs | Exclude or keep only if useful to source readers. |
| Release/signing/publish workflows | Source-owned; do not overwrite casually. |
| Secrets-heavy workflow changes | Source-owned; hold for explicit release/security review. |

## Excluded Work Examples

Promotion PRs should list work that remains in swarm:

- draft or proof-gated PRs;
- diagnostic-only receipts;
- old PRs without content disposition;
- hardware lanes without quality gates;
- performance candidates without behavior-backed benchmarks;
- broad model-family expansion not covered by the release.

Excluded work remains open or tracked in swarm. Do not close it in `BitNet-rs`
because a release was promoted.
