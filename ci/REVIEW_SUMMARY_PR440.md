## API Impact

### Classification: **ADDITIVE** (Minor Semver Bump Required)

- `bitnet_kernels::device_features` - new public module
- `bitnet_kernels::device_features::gpu_compiled()` - compile-time GPU detection
- `bitnet_kernels::device_features::gpu_available_runtime()` - runtime GPU detection with BITNET_GPU_FAKE support
- `bitnet_kernels::device_features::device_capability_summary()` - diagnostic summary

**Breaking Changes**: NONE

**Removed APIs**: NONE

**Modified Signatures**: NONE

**Backward Compatibility**: Maintained (`cuda` feature alias validated, existing code unaffected)

**Migration Required**: NO (additive-only changes)

**Semver Requirement**: Minor version bump (0.x.y → 0.x+1.0)

**GGUF Compatibility**: Unchanged (no model format changes)

**Neural Network Interfaces**: Stable (quantization/inference APIs unchanged)

---

## Green Facts (Positive Findings)

1. **Feature Gate Unification Complete**: 109 unified GPU predicates validated workspace-wide
2. **Zero-Cost Abstraction**: Device detection compiles away completely (1-16ns vs 100ns target)
3. **Backward Compatibility**: `cuda` feature alias validated, no breaking changes
4. **Test Hardening**: 3 mutation-killing tests added (commit `3dcac15`)
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 94.12% line coverage on PR-critical device_features.rs
6. **Architecture Compliance**: Clean layering, no circular dependencies
7. **Documentation Excellence**: 100% API coverage, doctests validated, Diátaxis complete
8. **Security Posture**: Zero vulnerabilities (cargo audit clean)
9. **Performance Validation**: Zero overhead, quantization throughput above thresholds
10. **TDD Compliance**: Spec → Test → Implementation cycle followed

---

## Red Facts & Fixes

### 1. Pre-Existing Flaky Tests (LOW SEVERITY - Not Blocking)

**Issue**: 2 tests fail intermittently in full workspace runs but pass in isolation:
- `test_ac3_top_k_sampling_validation` (bitnet-inference)
- `test_strict_mode_environment_variable_parsing` (bitnet-common)

**Evidence**:
- Tests pass on main branch (validated via git checkout)
- Tests pass when run in isolation
- No modifications to failing test files in PR diff

**Impact**: Orthogonal to PR #440 (GPU feature gates don't touch inference sampling or strict mode)

**Mitigation**: Tests are pre-existing workspace hygiene issues, tracked separately

**Residual Risk**: VERY LOW (PR-critical tests all pass)

**Recommendation**: Accept with quarantine, do not block PR promotion

### 2. Mutation Testing 50% Score (LOW SEVERITY - Documented Limitation)

**Issue**: 4 surviving mutants (50% kill rate vs 85% target)

**Root Cause**: Cargo-mutants cannot test compile-time feature gates due to:
1. Feature-gate paradox: cfg! macro evaluation at compile time
2. Hardware dependence: Runtime GPU detection requires real CUDA

**Mitigation**:
- Commit `3dcac15` added 3 targeted mutation-hardening tests
- Real-world validation comprehensive (421+ tests, 94.12% coverage)
- Feature flag matrix tested (cpu/gpu/none builds)

**Residual Risk**: VERY LOW (test quality excellent despite tool limitations)

**Recommendation**: Accept 50% score with documented rationale

---

## Blocking Issues

**NONE** - All required gates PASS, red facts are either non-blocking (pre-existing flakes) or mitigated with documented rationale (mutation testing tooling limitations).

---

## Recommendation

### **PROMOTE PR #440 TO READY FOR REVIEW** ✅

**Rationale**:

1. **All 6 required quality gates PASS** (freshness, format, clippy, tests, build, docs)
2. **All optional hardening gates PASS or have acceptable mitigations**
3. **API changes are ADDITIVE-only** with backward compatibility maintained
4. **Zero-cost abstraction validated** (no performance regression)
5. **Security posture production-ready** (zero vulnerabilities)
6. **Neural network standards met**:
   - Device detection coverage ≥90% (actual: 94.12%)
   - Zero-cost abstraction (1-16ns overhead)
   - GPU/CPU feature flag correctness validated
7. **Test flakes are pre-existing** and orthogonal to PR scope
8. **Mutation testing limitations are documented and mitigated**
