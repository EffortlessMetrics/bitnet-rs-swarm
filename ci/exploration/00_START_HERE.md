## The 4 PRs at a Glance

### PR1: QK256 Test Fixtures (95% Complete) ✅
**Files**: 9 test files in `crates/bitnet-models/tests/qk256_*.rs`

**Status**: All tests properly gated with `#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "fixtures"), ignore)]`

**What's Done**:
- Fixture generators with deterministic seeds
- Detection tests (4x256, 2x64, 3x300)
- Dual-flavor (BitNet-32 vs QK256) detection
- Error handling and AVX2 parity

**Missing**: Minor cleanup of dead_code markers

**Action**: READY - minor polish only

---

### PR2: EnvGuard Consolidation (90% Complete) ✅
**Files**: `tests/support/env_guard.rs` (399 LOC) + 15 annotated test files

**Status**: Thread-safe + process-level serialization with OnceLock isolation

**What's Done**:
- Two-tiered approach (scoped preferred, RAII fallback)
- Global `ENV_LOCK` mutex with poison recovery
- Automatic restoration even on panic
- 8 comprehensive tests demonstrating all patterns
- 15 test files confirmed with `#[serial(bitnet_env)]` annotations

**Missing**: Legacy tests in `tests/` directory need audit

**Action**: READY - legacy audit recommended as follow-up

---

### PR3: Perf/Receipts Integration (85% Complete) ✅
**Files**: CI workflow + 5 receipt examples + 3 perf scripts

**Status**: Schema defined, CI workflow complete, benchmark scripts functional

**What's Done**:
- Receipt schema v1.0.0 with validation rules
- Positive/negative examples in `docs/tdd/receipts/`
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/verify-receipts.yml`
- Performance baselines in `docs/baselines/perf/`
- Phase 2 timing script for automated measurement

**Missing**: ⚠️ xtask verify-receipt implementation not code-reviewed (verified via CI only)

**Action**: BLOCKING - verify xtask implementation before merge

---

### PR4: Strict Mode API (80% Complete) ✅
**Files**: `crates/bitnet-common/src/strict_mode.rs` (350 LOC) + integration tests

**Status**: Test-only API implemented, environment-isolated, OnceLock-bypassing

**What's Done**:
- `StrictModeEnforcer::new_test_with_config(bool)` for test isolation
- `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "test-util"))]` gating with `#[doc(hidden)]`
- Validation methods for mock detection, kernel requirements, performance metrics
- 3 embedded tests + `issue_260_strict_mode_tests.rs` integration tests

**Missing**: Some tests blocked waiting for Issue #260 resolution

**Action**: READY - blocked tests expected, not blocking merge

---

## Blocking Items (MUST Resolve Before Merge)

### 1. ⚠️ Verify xtask verify-receipt Implementation
**Status**: Command exists in CI but source code not reviewed

**Current State**:
```bash
cargo run -p xtask --release -- verify-receipt --path <file>
```

**Action Required**:
```bash
# Find the implementation
find /path/to/code -name "*.rs" | xargs grep -l "verify.receipt\|verify_receipt"

# Review source code and validation logic
# Confirm it implements all checks from verify-receipts.yml:
#  - Schema version 1.0.0
#  - compute_path must be "real"
#  - kernels array validation
#  - Backend-kernel alignment
```

**Owner**: Lead reviewer  
**Timeline**: Before merge  
**Risk**: Medium (affects receipt validation infrastructure)

### 2. ✅ Test receipt verification CI workflow
**Status**: Workflow defined but conditional on main/develop

**Current State**:
```yaml
if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
```

**Action Required**:
```bash
# Test the workflow:
gh workflow run verify-receipts.yml
gh run list --workflow=verify-receipts.yml
```

**Expected Results**:
- Positive example test passes
- Negative example test fails (correctly)
- Summary shows validation rules applied

**Owner**: CI engineer  
**Timeline**: Before merge  
**Risk**: Low (straightforward workflow test)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Merge)
- [ ] Review and verify xtask verify-receipt source code
- [ ] Run receipt verification CI workflow and confirm all checks pass
- [ ] Document findings in merge commit message

### Short-term (1-2 weeks post-merge)
- [ ] Audit legacy test files in `tests/` directory for serial annotations
- [ ] Create automated CI check for env-using tests without serial annotations
- [ ] Consolidate receipt naming convention across examples
- [ ] Document performance measurement methodology in CLAUDE.md

### Medium-term (next sprint)
- [ ] Expand CI receipt verification to all PRs (currently main/develop only)
- [ ] Enhance benchmark receipt generation to capture JSON automatically
- [ ] Create architecture decision record for receipt schema stability
- [ ] Expand CI enhanced mode usage across validation gates

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Can I merge PR1 independently?**  
A: Yes, PR1 is self-contained. Gating with feature="fixtures" makes it safe.

**Q: Does PR2 require all env-using tests to have serial annotations?**  
A: Yes, current status shows 15 files have them. Legacy tests in `tests/` directory need audit.

**Q: What's the risk with PR3's xtask verify-receipt?**  
A: Implementation not code-reviewed. Risk is low-medium: workflow is in CI and appears functional, but validation logic should be verified before relying on it.

**Q: When can I use the strict mode test-only API?**  
A: Now. It's in PR4 and properly gated. Safe for all test code.

**Q: Do I need to wait for Issue #260 to resolve?**  
A: No. Some tests marked #[ignore] are blocked, but they don't block merge. PR4 test-only API is usable immediately.
