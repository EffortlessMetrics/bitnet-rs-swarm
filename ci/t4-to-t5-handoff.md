# Handoff: Security Validator → Benchmark Runner

**From:** generative-security-validator (T4)
**To:** generative-benchmark-runner (T5)
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Branch:** feat/issue-453-strict-quantization-guards
**Flow:** generative

## Security Gate Results

**Status:** ✅ PASS

### Validation Summary
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** 0 known vulnerabilities (727 dependencies scanned)
- **Memory Safety:** 0 unsafe blocks in production code (Issue #453)
- **Environment Variables:** Safe parsing with proper defaults
- **Panic Safety:** All panics properly gated with `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`
- **Secrets Scanning:** No hardcoded credentials found
- **Test Coverage:** 83 tests passed (100%)

### Pre-existing Issues (Out of Scope)
- 3 `unwrap()` violations in build scripts (build-time only, no runtime security impact)
  - `bitnet-kernels/build.rs:52`
  - `bitnet-st-tools/src/common.rs:26`
  - `bitnet-ffi/build.rs:5`

## Implementation Quality

### Code Security Assessment
- **Production Code:** No unsafe blocks, proper error handling via `Result<()>`
- **Test Code:** Minimal unsafe usage (environment variable manipulation only)
- **Environment Variable Parsing:** Safe with defaults, no panic risks
- **Panic Safety:** Debug-only panics for fallback detection (never in release builds)

### Neural Network Security
- **Quantization Security:** No new SIMD intrinsics, kernel safety maintained
- **GPU Memory Safety:** Device boundaries unchanged
- **FFI Bridge Security:** Not modified in Issue #453
- **Inference Pipeline Security:** Strict mode prevents mock evasion

## Next Steps (Benchmark Runner)

### Required Validations
1. **Performance Benchmarking:**
   - Run `cargo run -p xtask -- benchmark --model <model.gguf> --tokens 128`
   - Verify TPS meets quality gates (CPU: 20-40 tok/s, GPU: 100-120 tok/s)
   - Validate receipt generation (compute_path == "real")

2. **Strict Mode Validation:**
   - Test with `BITNET_STRICT_MODE=1` to verify quantization enforcement
   - Ensure no FP32 fallback in strict mode
   - Validate kernel IDs in receipt (non-empty, length ≤ 128)

3. **Receipt Verification:**
   - Run `cargo run -p xtask -- verify-receipt`
   - Validate schema compliance (v1.0.0)
   - Check kernel ID hygiene

### Expected Outcomes
- Benchmark completes with real quantized kernels
- Receipt validates successfully
- Performance meets quality gates
- No mock computation detected

### Blocking Issues
None. Security validation passed cleanly.

## Artifacts

### Generated Files
- `ci/t4-security-validation-report.md` - Comprehensive security assessment
- `ci/quality-gate-check-run.md` - GitHub Check Run summary
- `ci/ledger.md` - Updated PR Ledger with security gate results

### Key Metrics
- **Vulnerabilities:** 0
- **Unsafe Blocks (Production):** 0
- **Tests Passed:** 83/83
- **Coverage:** 72.92%

## Routing Decision

**NEXT → generative-benchmark-runner**

Security validation complete. Strict quantization guards are memory-safe and ready for performance validation.
