> Historical validation artifact only. This report records the 2025 PR #473
> post-merge finalization decision and must not be read as a current BitNet-rs
> support, AVX2 speedup, CUDA/GPU, server-readiness, residency, or
> product-readiness claim. Current claims must come from active receipts and
> claim gates.

## Neural Network Validation Evidence

### Inference Performance
- **Throughput**: 2.8 seconds (well within 10-second SLO)
- **Status**: Historical performance target recorded for this gate
- **Quantization Accuracy**: >99% for I2S, TL1, TL2 vs FP32 reference
- **Cross-Validation**: Rust vs C++ parity within 1e-5 tolerance

### Feature Validation
- **QK256 AVX2**: historical gate recorded ~1.2x speedup with runtime dispatch
  and scalar fallback; not a current accepted speedup claim
- **Stop Token Lookup**: O(1) implementation (HashSet, from binary search)
- **Receipt Schema**: v1.0.0 with compute_path enforcement
- **Health Endpoints**: <200ms SLO compliance
- **GPU Compatibility**: historical CUDA validation note; not a current CUDA
  support promotion

## BitNet-rs MVP Baseline

**Version**: v0.1.0-qna-mvp
**Release Date**: 2025-10-22 (via PR #473 merge)
**Status**: Historical MVP baseline record; not a current product-readiness
claim

### Validated Features
- CPU inference with SIMD optimization (AVX2/AVX-512/NEON)
- GPU inference with CUDA acceleration (feature-gated)
- QK256 quantization with AVX2 kernels and scalar fallback
- O(1) stop token lookup with unified priority logic
- Health endpoint monitoring (<200ms SLO)
- Receipt validation schema v1.0.0
- Cross-validation framework against C++ reference
- Interactive chat and Q&A with auto-detection

### Known Limitations
- QK256 scalar kernels: ~0.1 tok/s baseline (SIMD planned)
- AVX2 speedup: historical ~1.2x gate note; current speed claims require
  exact-profile receipts and claim review
- Model quality: microsoft-bitnet-b1.58 has known issues
- Test scaffolding: ~70 intentionally ignored tests (TDD)
- Fixtures: Pending Issue #254 resolution

## Next Steps

### Immediate (0-1 week)
1. Monitor main branch CI for integration issues
2. Issue #474: Optional low-priority fuzz harness fix

### v0.2.0 Planning (1-4 weeks)
1. QK256 AVX2 SIMD optimization (target ≥3× uplift)
2. Native TL1/TL2 kernel implementations
3. Nibble-LUT and FMA tiling
4. Performance profiling enhancements

### Long-Term (>1 month)
1. Production SLO targets (<5s for 2B models)
2. Extended model compatibility
3. Performance benchmarking suite
4. Community feedback integration

## Files and Evidence

### Key Files Modified
- **Quantization**: crates/bitnet-quantization/ (QK256 AVX2, accuracy tests)
- **Inference**: crates/bitnet-inference/ (stop logic, O(1) lookup)
- **Kernels**: crates/bitnet-kernels/ (AVX2 dequant, dispatch)
- **Server**: crates/bitnet-server/ (health endpoints)
- **CLI**: crates/bitnet-cli/ (inference, receipts)
- **Tests**: tests/, bitnet-tests/ (620+ tests, 88% mutation score)
- **Documentation**: docs/, CLAUDE.md (comprehensive, 38+ doctests)
