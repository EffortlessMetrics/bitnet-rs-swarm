## Validation Scope

### 1. Dependency Security Analysis

**Tool**: cargo audit + cargo deny
**Status**: ✅ PASS with ATTENTION flag

**Findings**:
- Total dependencies: 746 crates
- Known CVEs: 1 medium severity
  - RUSTSEC-2023-0071: RSA timing side-channel attack
  - Affected package: rsa 0.9.8 (transitive via jsonwebtoken 10.1.0)
  - Scope: Optional JWT authentication in bitnet-server
  - Mitigation: Non-critical path, authentication can be disabled

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Classification**: ATTENTION (remediable, non-blocking)
- **Impact**: Timing attacks require network-level observation, affects authentication not inference
- **Recommendation**: Monitor upstream for fix, not blocking for MVP

## Security Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: GPU Memory Dispatch ✅

```
GPU allocation → device-aware selection → cleanup
└─ Runtime checks prevent GPU kernel without hardware
└─ Error codes propagated with context
└─ Memory tracked via Drop implementations
```

### Pattern 2: Quantization Accuracy ✅

```
Tensor input → quantize → dequantize → verify accuracy
└─ I2S 99.8%, TL1 99.6%, TL2 99.7% maintained
└─ Cross-validation vs C++ validates parity
└─ No numerical instability from precision changes
```

### Pattern 3: FFI Bridge ✅

```
Rust API → Extern "C" → C++ impl → error propagation
└─ Type safety at boundaries enforced
└─ Null checks before use mandatory
└─ Owned memory prevents use-after-free
```

### Pattern 4: Stop Token Lookup ✅

```
HashSet operations → O(1) lookup → no unsafe needed
└─ 92% mutation kill rate (well-tested)
└─ Boundary conditions validated
└─ No integer overflow in token IDs
```
