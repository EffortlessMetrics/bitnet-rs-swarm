- **Validation Duration**: 1.2min total (15% of 8min SLO budget)

## Mutation Testing Assessment (integrative:gate:mutation)

**Status**: ⚠️ ACTION_REQUIRED - Policy Decision or Manual Sampling Needed

**Scope Analysis**:
- **Total Mutants**: 563 (cargo mutants --list on bitnet-tokenizers package)
- **Estimated Runtime**: ~37 minutes (563 mutants × ~4s avg per mutant)
- **Timeout Constraint**: 15 minute practical limit (mutation testing timeouts observed)
- **Test Suite**: 220/220 tests passing (100% pass rate)

**Mutation Hardening Evidence**:
- **Committed Hardening**: test_mutation_hardening.rs (196 lines added in commit af1708b)
- **Target**: 147 surviving mutants addressed from previous 16% → goal ≥80% mutation score
- **Hardening Focus**:
  - Encode/decode return value mutations (Ok(vec![]), Ok(String::new()))
  - Special token ID mutations (bos_token_id, eos_token_id exact values)
  - Vocab size validation boundary conditions (0, 1, 2M tokens)
  - Architecture detection exact value checks

**Partial Mutation Run Observations** (from timeout captures):
- Many mutants in non-core tokenizer wrappers (sp_tokenizer.rs, spm_tokenizer.rs, hf_tokenizer.rs)
- Mock tokenizer mutants (test infrastructure, low priority)
- Universal tokenizer backend selection logic
- Source name string mutations (non-critical)

**Classification**: bitnet-tokenizers = **Utility/Integration Layer** (NOT neural network core)
- ✅ Core neural network: bitnet-quantization, bitnet-kernels, bitnet-inference
- ⚠️ Tokenizers: Input preprocessing, not quantization/inference algorithms

**Recommendation Options**:

1. **Policy-Based Skip** (Recommended for utility layers):
   - Tokenizers are input processing, not neural network compute core
   - 220/220 tests pass with mutation hardening in place
   - Focus mutation testing on quantization/inference/kernels (neural network SLOs)
   - Document as: `skipped (bounded by policy): non-neural-network utility layer`

2. **Manual Sampling** (Alternative for partial validation):
   - Sample 50 mutants from core files (discovery.rs, strategy.rs, gguf_tokenizer.rs)
   - Estimated time: ~3-5 minutes for subset validation
   - Provides spot-check evidence without full 37-minute run

3. **Full Run with Extended Timeout** (Not recommended):
   - Requires 40+ minute allocation
   - May exceed practical CI/CD time budgets
   - Diminishing returns for utility layer validation

**Decision Required**: User or architect must approve policy-based skip OR request manual sampling

## Routing Decision

**Status**: PENDING MUTATION GATE DECISION → integrative-test-runner (T3) OR mutation-policy-reviewer

**Justification**:
- All 4 critical feature combinations build and test successfully
- Universal tokenizer discovery system fully functional across CPU/GPU/SPM features
- Core neural network components validated: quantization (41/41), GGUF loading (94/94), tokenizers (18/18)
- Zero clippy warnings with strict enforcement
- Bounded policy compliance: 1.2min ≪ 8min SLO
- Known limitations are test infrastructure improvements, not production blockers
- Ready for T3 core integration test execution

**Next Agent**: integrative-test-runner
**Expected Actions**: Execute comprehensive workspace integration tests with CPU and GPU features

<!-- hoplog:end -->

<!-- decision:start -->
**State:** mutation_gate_pending
**Why:** Mutation testing gate requires policy decision: 563 mutants in bitnet-tokenizers (utility layer) with 37min estimated runtime exceeds 15min timeout limit. Test suite: 220/220 pass (100%). Mutation hardening committed (test_mutation_hardening.rs, 196 lines). Classification: tokenizers = non-neural-network core (input preprocessing vs quantization/inference compute). Options: (1) policy-based skip for utility layer, (2) manual sampling (50 mutants, 3-5min), or (3) extended timeout (not recommended).
**Next:** USER DECISION REQUIRED → Policy skip approval OR manual sampling request → Then: integrative-test-runner (T3)

## Policy Gate Results (integrative:gate:policy)

**SHA**: a48c4673780071002bd65ff1a280b3cfd91ba19c
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-03 T5.5 Execution
**Agent**: policy-fixer
**Status**: ✅ PASS

### Violations Resolved

**Clippy Violations in bitnet-tokenizers** (4 mechanical fixes applied):

1. ✅ **Unused Import** (`discovery.rs:758`):
   - **Issue**: `use crate::error_handling::ModelTypeDetector` not feature-gated
   - **Fix**: Removed and re-added with `#[cfg(feature = "cpu")]` feature gate
   - **Evidence**: Import now properly scoped to cpu feature tests

2. ✅ **Boolean Expression Simplification** (`mutation_killer_tests.rs:418`):
   - **Issue**: `!(!byte_buf.is_empty())` double negation pattern
   - **Fix**: Simplified to `byte_buf.is_empty()`
   - **Evidence**: Clippy nonminimal_bool violation resolved

3. ✅ **Assert on Constant** (`mutation_killer_tests.rs:428`):
   - **Issue**: `assert!(true, "message")` optimized out by compiler
   - **Fix**: Removed constant assertion, logic verified by reaching branch
   - **Evidence**: Clippy assertions_on_constants violation resolved

4. ✅ **Vec Init Pattern** (`mutation_killer_tests.rs:701`):
   - **Issue**: `Vec::new()` followed by immediate `push()` calls
   - **Fix**: Replaced with `vec![72, 105]` macro pattern
   - **Evidence**: Clippy vec_init_then_push violation resolved

### Validation Evidence

✅ **Clippy Clean**: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --no-default-features --features cpu -- -D warnings` → 0 errors
✅ **Tests Pass**: bitnet-tokenizers mutation_killer_tests → 29/29 passed
✅ **Formatting**: `cargo fmt --all --check` → clean
✅ **Pre-commit Hooks**: All checks passed (no mock features, no debug prints, no TODOs, no secrets, formatting, clippy)

### Commit Evidence

**Commit**: a48c4673780071002bd65ff1a280b3cfd91ba19c
**Message**: fix: resolve clippy violations in tokenizer tests (PR #430)
**Files Changed**: 2 files (discovery.rs, mutation_killer_tests.rs)
**Lines**: +4/-7 (net reduction through simplification)

### Policy Compliance Summary

policy: clippy violations resolved (4/4 mechanical fixes); tests verified 29/29 pass; workspace clean -D warnings; formatting intact; commit a48c467

**Routing Decision**: NEXT → policy-gatekeeper (re-validate policy gate, verify no new violations)
