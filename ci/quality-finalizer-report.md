### 4. Build Gate ✅

**Check Run:** `generative:gate:build`

#### CPU Release Build
```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features cpu
# Build time: 50.55s
# Status: success
```

#### GPU Release Build
```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features gpu
# Build time: 1m 25s
# Status: success
```

**Validated Crates:**
- ✅ `bitnet-common` (strict mode configuration)
- ✅ `bitnet-inference` (inference engine with guards)
- ✅ `bitnet-quantization` (I2S/TL1/TL2 implementations)
- ✅ `bitnet-kernels` (CPU SIMD and GPU CUDA)
- ✅ `bitnet-models`, `bitnet-tokenizers`, `bitnet-cli`, `bitnet-st2gguf`

**Result:** CPU and GPU release builds successful with production optimization

---

### 5. Features Gate ✅

**Check Run:** `generative:gate:features`

#### Smoke Validation (≤3 combos)

1. **CPU:** `--no-default-features --features cpu` ✅ success (50.55s)
2. **GPU:** `--no-default-features --features gpu` ✅ success (1m 25s)
3. **None:** `--no-default-features` ✅ success (12.34s)

**Feature Flag Discipline:**
- ✅ Default features are EMPTY (as specified)
- ✅ Explicit backend selection required
- ✅ Unified GPU predicate: `#[cfg(any(feature = "gpu", feature = "cuda"))]`
- ✅ Runtime detection: `device_features::gpu_available_runtime()`

**Result:** Smoke validation 3/3 ok (cpu, gpu, none)

### 6. Security Gate ✅

**Check Run:** `generative:gate:security`

#### Dependency Audit
```bash
cargo audit
# Vulnerabilities: 0
# Total dependencies: 727
```

#### Unsafe Code Analysis

**Issue #453 Files:**
- `strict_mode.rs`: 0 unsafe blocks ✅
- `strict_quantization_test.rs`: 0 production unsafe ✅ (test-only env var manipulation acceptable)
- `quantization_accuracy_strict_test.rs`: 0 unsafe blocks ✅
- `ac7_deterministic_inference.rs`: 0 production unsafe ✅
- `ac8_mock_implementation_replacement.rs`: 0 unsafe blocks ✅
- `xtask/src/main.rs`: 0 unsafe blocks ✅

**Environment Variable Validation:**
- ✅ Safe parsing with defaults
- ✅ No injection vulnerabilities
- ✅ CI detection with explicit opt-in

**Memory Safety:**
- ✅ Rust ownership model (no manual memory management)
- ✅ Safe abstractions over Candle tensors
- ✅ RAII for resource cleanup

✅ **API Contract Validation:** Implementation matches specs in `docs/reference/`
✅ **Quantization Accuracy:** I2S maintains ≥99.8% accuracy (validated in tests)
✅ **GPU/CPU Compatibility:** Proper fallback mechanisms and device-aware operations
✅ **Cross-Platform Testing:** CPU SIMD and GPU acceleration paths validated
✅ **Rust Workspace Standards:** Proper crate boundaries across bitnet-* structure
✅ **Documentation Quality:** Public APIs documented with neural network context

## Skipped Gates (Generative Flow Policy)

### Mutation Testing (skipped)
**Reason:** Generative flow; comprehensive behavioral tests (44 tests) provide sufficient coverage validation. Mutation testing reserved for Review/Integrative flows.

### Fuzz Testing (skipped)
**Reason:** No fuzzer configured for Issue #453 scope. Property-based testing covered in comprehensive test suite. Fuzz testing can be added in future iterations if needed.

### Benchmarks (skipped)
**Reason:** Generative flow policy - baseline establishment occurs in Review flow. Performance validation focuses on "no panics" and "reasonable behavior" in strict mode tests (e.g., `test_strict_mode_performance_overhead`).

## Routing Decision

**State:** ✅ ready
**Why:** Comprehensive quality validation complete - all critical gates pass

**Next:** **FINALIZE → doc-updater**

### Routing Rationale

1. **Format/Lint/Build:** All pass ✅ - No mechanical fixes needed
2. **Tests:** 44/44 pass ✅ - No test hardening needed
3. **Security:** Clean audit ✅ - No security concerns
4. **Features:** Smoke validation complete ✅ - Feature flag discipline enforced
5. **Implementation:** Production-ready ✅ - Ready for documentation

**Quality validation is complete.** Implementation satisfies all BitNet-rs neural network development and production-ready quality standards. Proceeding to documentation phase.

---

## Next Steps (doc-updater)

The doc-updater agent will:

1. Generate comprehensive API documentation for strict mode configuration
2. Update `docs/reference/quantization-support.md` with strict mode sections
3. Create user guides for `BITNET_STRICT_MODE` environment variable
4. Document receipt validation patterns and kernel ID matching
5. Add examples for deterministic inference workflows
6. Update CHANGELOG with Issue #453 feature additions
