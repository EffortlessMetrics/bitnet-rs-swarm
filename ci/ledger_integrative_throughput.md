# Ledger Gates - Integrative Throughput Validation

## integrative:gate:throughput

**Status**: ⚠️ NEUTRAL (Compilation Issues Block Real Inference)
**Evidence**: `/home/steven/code/Rust/BitNet-rs/ci/ledger_integrative_throughput.md`

### T4 BitNet-rs Neural Network Throughput Assessment

#### ✅ VALIDATED - Basic Functionality
- **Branch Freshness**: Current HEAD 8ef0823 ahead of main by 27 commits, no rebase needed
- **Model Availability**: BitNet I2S model `models/microsoft-bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-gguf/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf` (1.2GB) available
- **Tokenizer**: LLaMA-3 tokenizer `models/llama3-tokenizer/tokenizer.json` (8.7MB) available
- **GPU Hardware**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti (16GB) detected and available
- **Mock Inference**: 200 tokens/sec baseline established via mock implementation

#### 🔧 COMPILATION BLOCKS - Real Throughput Validation
1. **Feature Flag Issues**:
   - Inference requires `--features inference` but compilation fails
   - Mixed precision GPU kernel tests have undefined types (SIMDKernel, OptimizationLevel, CacheOptimizedKernel)
   - Quantization crate compilation errors with AccuracyReport correlation field missing

2. **Test Infrastructure Issues**:
   - 21 compilation errors in `crates/bitnet-kernels/tests/mixed_precision_gpu_kernels.rs`
   - Fuzz targets fail compilation (12 errors in quantization_i2s.rs)
   - GPU preflight test failure: `test_gpu_preflight_with_no_gpu` unexpectedly passes

3. **Feature Dependencies**:
   - BitNet benchmark requires inference feature which cannot build
   - GPU tests compilation blocked by missing kernel implementations
   - Cross-validation tests require C++ backend availability

#### 🚦 PARTIAL VALIDATION RESULTS

##### CPU Tests: MIXED SUCCESS
- **Workspace Tests**: 280 CPU tests pass, 10 pass with 1 GPU preflight failure, 2 ignored
- **Mock Inference**: 32 tokens in 170ms → 200 tokens/sec (deterministic mode)
- **Compilation**: xtask builds successfully for mock operations

##### GPU Tests: BLOCKED BY COMPILATION
- **Hardware**: RTX 5070 Ti available (5.7GB/16GB memory used)
- **Detection**: CUDA 13.0 driver 581.29 properly detected
- **Compilation**: Mixed precision kernel tests fail to compile
- **Memory Safety**: Cannot validate due to compilation blocks

##### Performance Baselines: AVAILABLE BUT INCOMPLETE
- **Performance JSON**: 64K token baselines exist with inference_first_token benchmarks
- **Real Model**: I2S quantization model available but inference feature blocked
- **SLO Target**: ≤10 seconds target cannot be validated due to compilation

#### 📊 NEURAL NETWORK EVIDENCE SUMMARY
- `freshness: base up-to-date @8ef0823`
- `mock_inference: 200 tokens/sec baseline (170ms for 32 tokens)`
- `model: BitNet I2S 1.2GB available`
- `gpu: RTX 5070 Ti detected, compilation blocked`
- `cpu: 280/280 tests pass, 1 GPU preflight fail`
- `compilation: 21+ errors block real throughput validation`
- `slo: cannot validate ≤10s target (inference feature unavailable)`

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDINGS
1. **Inference Disabled**: "Inference feature not enabled. Build with `--features inference` for real inference"
2. **Compilation Regression**: Multiple kernel implementation files missing required types
3. **CI Failures**: 25+ GitHub checks failing across all CI workflows
4. **Mutation Gate**: 20% mutation detection (target: ≥80%) - FAILED
5. **Real Throughput**: Cannot measure actual tokens/sec due to feature compilation blocks

### Next Action Assessment

#### BLOCKED STATUS ANALYSIS
- **Security Gate**: ✅ PASS (1 unmaintained dependency, comprehensive validation)
- **Mutation Gate**: ❌ FAILED (20% detection rate, neural network vulnerabilities)
- **Format/Clippy**: ⚠️ MIXED (passes locally, fails in CI with 21+ compilation errors)
- **Throughput Gate**: ⚠️ NEUTRAL (mock validation only, real inference blocked)
- **All CI Checks**: ❌ FAILED (25+ failures across all workflows)

#### ROUTING DECISION
**ROUTE → perf-fixer**: Critical compilation issues must be resolved before real neural network throughput validation can proceed. Mock baseline of 200 tokens/sec established but real BitNet I2S model inference requires working `--features inference` build.

### Required Remediation
1. **Immediate**: Fix compilation errors in mixed precision GPU kernels
2. **Critical**: Restore inference feature functionality for real model validation
3. **Essential**: Resolve fuzz target compilation failures
4. **Performance**: Validate actual BitNet I2S throughput ≤10s SLO after compilation fixes
