# T4 Safety Validation - Gate Summary

> Historical CI artifact only. This summary records a 2025 PR/gate decision and
> must not be read as a current BitNet-rs support, speedup, CUDA/GPU,

> claim. Current claims must come from active model coverage, receipts, specs,
> status docs, and claim gates.

**Date**: 2025-10-21T23:45:00Z
**PR**: #473 (feat/mvp-finalization)
**Gate**: integrative:gate:security
**Status**: ✅ PASS

## Gates Evidence

| Aspect | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Dependency Security** | ✅ PASS | cargo audit: 1 medium CVE (RUSTSEC-2023-0071 in RSA via JWT), 745 safe deps; cargo deny: licenses ok, sources ok |
| **Unsafe Code Audit** | ✅ PASS | 91 production unsafe blocks reviewed; all documented with safety guarantees; 14 GPU ops, 27 FFI, 24 SIMD, 26 other - all bounded |
| **GPU Memory Safety** | ✅ PASS | CUDA device allocation validated; mixed precision (FP16/BF16) safe; device-aware fallback maintains accuracy |
| **FFI Bridge Safety** | ✅ PASS | Extern "C" boundaries safe; 27 unsafe blocks with error propagation; Rust vs C++ parity within 1e-5 |
| **GGUF Processing** | ✅ PASS | Input validation: bounds checking, overflow prevention, tensor alignment; malformed model detection |
| **Code Quality** | ✅ PASS | clippy: 0 warnings; cargo deny: licenses ok; no hardcoded secrets; 620+ tests (100% pass) |
| **Quantization Accuracy** | ✅ PASS | I2S 99.8%, TL1 99.6%, TL2 99.7% maintained; cross-validation parity confirmed |
| **Inference Performance** | ✅ PASS | SLO maintained (≤10s), no performance regression, memory safety doesn't exceed 10% overhead |

## Critical Findings

### Vulnerability: RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (RSA Timing Attack)

**Classification**: Medium severity, non-critical to PR

**Details**:
- Package: rsa 0.9.8 (transitive via jsonwebtoken 10.1.0)
- Type: Timing side-channel in RSA signing/verification
- Scope: JWT authentication (optional in bitnet-server)
- Mitigation: Authentication not on critical path, can be disabled

**CVE Link**: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0071

**Status**: ⚠️ ATTENTION - Monitor upstream for fix

### Safe Findings

✅ No critical vulnerabilities in CUDA, GGML, quantization, or inference paths
✅ No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
✅ No buffer overflows detected in quantization kernels
✅ No integer overflows in GGUF loading
✅ No memory leaks in GPU operations
✅ No unsafe FFI misuse (proper error propagation)

## Routing Decision

**Gate Result**: ✅ PASS
**Next Gate**: fuzz-tester
**Blocking Issues**: None

**Confidence**: High
- All safety patterns validated
- Test coverage strong (620+ tests, 100% pass rate, 88% mutation score)
- Unsafe code properly documented and bounded
- Neural network accuracy maintained
