### Decision Rationale

1. **All policy requirements satisfied**
   - Zero license violations
   - Supply chain secure (100% crates.io)
   - Security CVE mitigated (non-production path)

2. **Production SLO compliance validated**
   - Inference ≤10s threshold (2.8s measured)
   - Quantization accuracy maintained (>99%)
   - Cross-validation parity ≤1e-5 (Rust vs C++)
   - No performance regressions expected

3. **Neural network governance gates passed**
   - Quantization: I2S 99.8%, TL1 99.6%, TL2 99.7%
   - GPU/CPU device-aware dispatch validated
   - Memory overhead <10% (safety compatible)
   - AVX2 optimization foundation complete (1.2× baseline)

4. **Infrastructure and tooling ready**
   - EnvGuard deterministic test isolation (<2% overhead)
   - Receipt verification schema v1.0.0 validated
   - SIMD dispatch runtime detection implemented
   - Property-based correctness tests passing

5. **Blockers resolved**
