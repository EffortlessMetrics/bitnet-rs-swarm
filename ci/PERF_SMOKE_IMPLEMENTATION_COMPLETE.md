# Performance Smoke Test Implementation Complete ✅

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a lightweight, non-gating performance smoke test in the main CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

**Purpose**: Provide early observability for major performance regressions without blocking development.

**Status**: ✅ Implementation complete, validated, and ready for deployment.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Lines added**: 83 lines
- **New job**: `perf-smoke`
- **Position**: After `test` job, before `api-compat` job

### Job Configuration

```yaml
perf-smoke:
  name: Performance Smoke Test (observability)
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [test]
  steps:
    - Download test model (xtask download-model)
    - Build CLI (release, cpu,full-cli features)
    - Run 4-token inference with timing
    - Post PR comment (if applicable)
```

### Key Features

1. **Non-Gating Architecture**
   - Step-level: `continue-on-error: true`
   - Error handling: Converts failures to warnings
   - Exit behavior: Always exits 0, even on inference failure
   - Clear documentation: Explains non-gating purpose inline

2. **Performance Configuration**
   - **Token budget**: 4 tokens (fast execution, ~12-30s expected)
   - **Sampling**: Greedy decode (`--temperature 0 --greedy`)
   - **Build**: Release mode for realistic performance
   - **Logging**: `RUST_LOG=warn` (minimal noise)
   - **Prompt**: `"2+2="` (simple, deterministic)

3. **Observability**
   - **Timing**: Manual start/end time measurement + bash `time`
   - **GitHub notices**: `::notice::Smoke test duration: Xs`
   - **Log grouping**: `::group::` for cleaner CI output
   - **PR comments**: Auto-posts informational comment (non-gating)

4. **Integration**
   - **Model**: Uses existing xtask infrastructure
   - **Path**: `models/microsoft-bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-gguf/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf`
   - **Tokenizer**: Bundled tokenizer.json from model directory
   - **Caching**: Leverages Swatinem/rust-cache for faster builds
   - **Dependencies**: Runs after `test` job completes

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Checks Passed

- **YAML syntax**: Valid (Python YAML parser)
- **Job dependencies**: Correct (`needs: [test]`)
- **Job names**: No duplicates
- **Feature flags**: Follows BitNet-rs conventions
- **Model paths**: Consistent with existing jobs
- **Non-gating config**: Properly implemented at step level
- **Complementarity**: Doesn't conflict with existing workflows

### Complementary Workflows

**Existing Performance Infrastructure:**
- `perf-gate.yml`: PR-specific, gating, comprehensive benchmarks
- `performance-tracking.yml`: Scheduled daily, baseline tracking
- `benchmark` job (ci.yml): Main branch, full Criterion suite

**This Smoke Test:**
- **Scope**: Quick 4-token check (not comprehensive)
- **Trigger**: All CI events (push, PR, dispatch, schedule)
- **Purpose**: Early observability signal
- **Execution**: Fast (<30s), non-blocking

## Example Outputs

### Success Case
```text
::group::Running performance smoke test
Note: This test is non-gating and provides performance observability only

real    0m12.345s
user    0m11.234s
sys     0m1.111s

Performance smoke test completed in 12s
::notice::Smoke test duration: 12s (4 tokens, greedy decode)
::endgroup::
```

### Failure Case (Non-Blocking)
```text
::warning::Performance smoke test inference failed (non-gating)
✅ Job continues successfully (exit 0)
```

### PR Comment (Auto-Posted)
```markdown
## Performance Smoke Test (Observability)

**Status**: ✅ Non-gating (informational only)
**Configuration**: 4 tokens, greedy decode, CPU inference
**Model**: microsoft-bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-gguf

This test provides visibility into performance changes but does not gate merges.
For detailed benchmarks, see the full benchmark suite.
```

## Local Testing

Reproduce the smoke test locally:

```bash
# Download model
cargo run -p xtask -- download-model

# Build CLI (release)
cargo build --release -p bitnet-cli --no-default-features --features cpu,full-cli

# Run smoke test
export RUST_LOG=warn
time target/release/bitnet-cli run \
  --model models/microsoft-bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-gguf/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf \
  --tokenizer models/microsoft-bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-gguf/tokenizer.json \
  --prompt "2+2=" \
  --max-tokens 4 \
  --temperature 0 --greedy
```

## Benefits

1. **Early Detection**: Catches major regressions early in CI pipeline
2. **Non-Blocking**: Doesn't prevent merges or slow development
3. **Fast Execution**: Small token budget avoids CI timeouts
4. **Visibility**: GitHub notices and PR comments increase awareness
5. **Low Overhead**: Leverages existing model download infrastructure
6. **Complementary**: Works alongside comprehensive benchmark suites

## Design Rationale

### Why Non-Gating?

Performance optimization is iterative. We want visibility into changes without:
- Blocking development on minor fluctuations
- Creating false positives from CI environment variance
- Slowing down the development workflow

### Why 4 Tokens?

- **Fast**: Avoids CI timeouts (QK256 MVP scalar ~0.1 tok/s)
- **Sufficient**: Exercises full inference pipeline
- **Stable**: Small budget reduces variance
- **Deterministic**: Greedy decode ensures reproducibility

### Why Release Build?

- **Realistic**: Matches production deployment
- **Stable**: Less variance than debug builds
- **Meaningful**: Performance numbers are comparable
- **Representative**: Shows real-world performance

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential improvements for later:

1. **Trend Analysis**
   - Store timing results as artifacts
   - Plot performance over time
   - Detect gradual degradation

2. **Threshold Alerts**
   - Optional gating on major regressions (>50% slower)
   - Configurable thresholds per component
   - Automated regression reports

3. **GPU Smoke Tests**
   - Add CUDA variant (requires GPU runner)
   - Compare CPU vs GPU performance
   - Validate GPU kernel selection

4. **Multi-Model Testing**
   - Test multiple quantization formats
   - Validate performance across model sizes
   - Ensure format-agnostic performance
