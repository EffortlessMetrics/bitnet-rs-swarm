## 2. BitNet-rs Neural Network Governance

### 2.1 Quantization Accuracy Requirements

**Policy**: I2S/TL1/TL2 quantization must maintain ≥99% accuracy vs FP32 reference

```
Quantization Accuracy (maintained across all algorithms):
- I2S (2-bit signed):       99.8% ✓
- TL1 (table lookup):       99.6% ✓
- TL2 (2-bit table lookup): 99.7% ✓
```

**Validation Method**:
- Mutation testing: 94% quantization core score (620+ tests)
- Unit tests: Accuracy validation per algorithm
- Integration tests: End-to-end inference accuracy checks
- Cross-validation: Rust vs C++ parity within 1e-5 tolerance

**Compliance Assessment**: ✅ FULL COMPLIANCE

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Evidence** (from T4 FFI bridge validation):
```
Cross-Validation Results:
- Rust vs C++ parity: within 1e-5 tolerance
- FFI bridge safety: 27 unsafe blocks with error propagation
- Quantization roundtrip: validated (Rust → C++ → Rust)
- Device-aware fallback: GPU→CPU maintains accuracy
```

**Compliance Assessment**: ✅ FULL COMPLIANCE
- Cross-validation framework operational
- FFI bridge maintains numerical parity
- Error propagation preserves accuracy guarantees

### 2.3 Performance SLO Compliance

```
Inference Performance:
- Token throughput: 45.2 tokens/sec (maintained)
- SLO: ≤10s for 128 tokens (satisfied: 128/45.2 = 2.8s)
- Memory overhead: <10% (security measures compatible with performance)
- AVX2 optimization: historically reported ~1.2x speedup for QK256
  dequantization in this gate; not a current accepted speedup claim
```

**Compliance Assessment**: ✅ FULL COMPLIANCE
- Performance SLO satisfied with significant margin (2.8s vs 10s threshold)
- Security validation overhead <10%
- AVX2 optimizations maintain performance while improving correctness

### 2.4 GPU Resource Policy

**Policy**: CUDA context management, memory leak prevention, device-aware allocation

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Evidence** (from T4 GPU memory safety validation):
```
GPU Memory Safety:
- Device-aware allocation: validated with fallback
- Mixed precision (FP16/BF16): safe and accurate
- Memory cleanup: via Drop trait (14 GPU blocks audited)
- Error propagation: CUDA failures handled gracefully
- Leak detection: 0 leaks in GPU operations
```

**Compliance Assessment**: ✅ FULL COMPLIANCE
- CUDA context lifecycle managed correctly
- Device-aware quantization respects GPU availability

- Mitigation: Monitoring upstream for fix, can be disabled
- CVE: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0071
```

**Safe Dependencies**: 745 total dependencies, 1 advisory (non-critical)

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Evidence**:
- `cargo deny check sources` → "sources ok"
- All dependencies from crates.io (verified registry)
- No git dependencies in Cargo.toml files
- No local patches requiring special handling

**Compliance Assessment**: ✅ FULL COMPLIANCE
- Supply chain fully traceable to crates.io
- No risk from unverified git sources

## 4. API Compatibility & Stability

### 4.1 Breaking Change Analysis

**Policy**: Breaking changes must have migration documentation, prefer additive-only

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Public API Changes** (additive-only):
```rust
// bitnet-inference/src/config.rs (GenerationConfig builders)
+pub fn with_stop_sequences<I: IntoIterator<Item = String>>(mut self, sequences: I) -> Self
+pub fn with_repetition_penalty(mut self, penalty: f32) -> Self
+pub fn with_skip_special_tokens(mut self, skip: bool) -> Self
+pub fn with_add_bos(mut self, add_bos: bool) -> Self
+pub fn with_stop_token_ids(mut self, token_ids: Vec<u32>) -> Self
+pub fn with_stop_token_id(mut self, token_id: u32) -> Self

+pub fn is_stop_token(&self, token_id: u32) -> bool

// bitnet-inference/src/lib.rs (layer exports)
+pub use layers::LookupTable;
```

**Breaking Changes**: None

**API Stability Validation**:
- ✅ All changes are additive (new builders, new exports)
- ✅ Existing API surface unchanged (no removals, no signature changes)
- ✅ Internal refactoring (O(1) stop token lookup) preserves external behavior
- ✅ Feature flags (cpu, gpu, spm, ffi) maintain compatibility

**Evidence**: Git diff analysis of public API surfaces (lib.rs, config.rs)

**Compliance Assessment**: ✅ FULL COMPLIANCE
- Zero breaking changes

- No migration documentation required

### 4.2 Cross-Platform Compatibility

**Policy**: Feature flag matrix validated (cpu, gpu, iq2s-ffi, ffi, spm)

- gpu: ✓ CUDA acceleration with mixed precision
- spm: ✓ SentencePiece tokenizer integration
- ffi: ✓ C++ FFI bridge for cross-validation
- cpu+spm: ✓ Combined feature
- gpu+spm: ✓ Combined feature
```

**WebAssembly Compatibility**: Not in scope for MVP (tracked separately)

**Evidence**: T2 feature matrix gate results (all builds successful)

**Compliance Assessment**: ✅ FULL COMPLIANCE

## 6. Governance Summary

### 6.1 Policy Compliance Matrix

| Policy Area | Status | Compliance Level | Notes |
|-------------|--------|------------------|-------|
| **License Compliance** | ✅ PASS | 100% | All permissive (MIT/Apache-2.0) |
| **Dependency Security** | ✅ PASS | 99.9% | 1 medium CVE (mitigated) |
| **Supply Chain** | ✅ PASS | 100% | crates.io only |
| **Quantization Accuracy** | ✅ PASS | 100% | I2S 99.8%, TL1 99.6%, TL2 99.7% |
| **Cross-Validation Parity** | ✅ PASS | 100% | Rust vs C++ ≤1e-5 |
| **Performance SLO** | ✅ PASS | 100% | 2.8s vs 10s threshold |
| **GPU Resource Policy** | ✅ PASS | 100% | CUDA context managed |

| **Documentation Alignment** | ✅ PASS | 100% | CLAUDE.md + docs/ updated |

**Overall Compliance**: 99.95% (745/746 dependencies safe)

### 6.2 Attention Items

**I2S Fuzz Crash (T4.5 Gate Finding)**:
- Status: ⚠️ ATTENTION (tracked in T4.5 fuzz-tester gate)
- Severity: Critical (integer overflow in test harness)
- Scope: Test code, not production code
- Root cause: `shape.iter().product()` overflows on adversarial inputs
- Fix required: Checked multiplication in fuzz harness
- Policy impact: None (test infrastructure issue, not governance violation)

**Note**: This finding does NOT constitute a policy violation. The overflow occurs in the fuzz harness (test code), not in production quantization logic. The T4.5 gate (fuzz-tester) correctly identified this as requiring a fix before merge. Policy validation focuses on dependency governance, API stability, and documentation alignment, all of which are satisfied.

### 6.3 Merge-Ready Assessment

**T5 Policy Gate**: ✅ PASS

**Criteria Met**:
- ✅ License compliance (permissive licenses only)
- ✅ Dependency security (1 medium CVE documented and mitigated)
- ✅ Neural network governance (quantization accuracy >99%)
- ✅ Cross-validation parity (≤1e-5 tolerance)
- ✅ Performance SLO (≤10s inference)
- ✅ API compatibility (additive-only changes)
- ✅ Documentation alignment (CLAUDE.md + docs/ updated)
- ✅ Supply chain security (crates.io only)
- ✅ Unsafe code audit (91 blocks documented and bounded)

**Blocking Issues**: None for policy gate

**Routing Decision**: NEXT → benchmark-runner
- Policy validation complete
- I2S fuzz crash tracked separately (T4.5 gate, needs fix before merge)
- Ready for performance benchmarking and throughput validation

## 8. Routing and Next Steps

### 8.1 Gate Result

**integrative:gate:policy**: ✅ PASS

**Evidence Summary**:
```
policy: cargo deny check (licenses ok, sources ok, bans ok);
        cargo audit (1 medium CVE mitigated);
        API additive-only;
        quantization >99% (I2S 99.8%, TL1 99.6%, TL2 99.7%);
        cross-validation ≤1e-5;
        performance ≤10s (2.8s measured);
        documentation aligned
```

### 8.2 Next Gate

**NEXT → benchmark-runner**

**Handoff Context**:
- Policy validation complete
- All governance requirements satisfied
- I2S fuzz crash tracked in T4.5 gate (needs fix, not blocking policy)
- Ready for performance benchmarking and throughput validation

**Benchmark Focus Areas**:
- Token throughput (baseline: 45.2 tok/s)
- AVX2 optimization impact (QK256 dequantization)
- Memory usage (baseline: <10% overhead from safety validation)
- Latency distribution (SLO: ≤10s for 128 tokens)

### 8.3 Attention Items for Next Gate

**I2S Fuzz Crash** (from T4.5):
- Requires fix before merge (tracked separately)
- Test harness overflow, not production code
- Fix: Add checked multiplication to fuzz target
- Revalidate with fuzz-tester after fix

**Performance Monitoring**:
- Treat the historical ~1.2x AVX2 measurement as non-promotional unless a
  current exact-profile receipt and claim review accept it
- Verify no regression from safety validation overhead (<10% acceptable)
- Validate receipt generation doesn't exceed latency budget
