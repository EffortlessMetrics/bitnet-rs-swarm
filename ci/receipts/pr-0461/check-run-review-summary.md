## Red Facts (4 minor non-blocking issues)

### 1. Integration Test Timeouts (Non-Blocking)
**Severity:** Minor
**Issue:** 5 GGUF weight loading tests timeout after 60+ seconds
**Affected:** AC3, AC7, AC9, AC10 in gguf_weight_loading_tests.rs
**Root Cause:** Long-running model file I/O operations
**Auto-fix:** N/A (infrastructure limitation)
**Residual Risk:** None (core functionality validated)

### 2. GPU Performance Baseline Unimplemented (Non-Blocking)
**Severity:** Minor (separate issue)
**Issue:** test_ac8_gpu_performance_baselines marked unimplemented
**Related to:** Issue #260 (NOT Issue #453/PR #461)
**Auto-fix:** N/A (tracked in Issue #260)
**Residual Risk:** None (not related to strict quantization guards)

### 3. Cosmetic Rustdoc Warnings (Non-Blocking)
**Severity:** Minor (cosmetic only)
**Issue:** 2 unclosed HTML tags in documentation comments
**Locations:**
- bitnet-st-tools/src/common.rs:165 (`Vec<u8>`)
- bitnet-common/src/types.rs:158 (`<hex>`)
**Auto-fix:** Add backticks to treat as inline code
**Residual Risk:** None (does not affect functionality)

### 4. WASM Build Limitation (Non-Blocking)
**Severity:** Minor (BitNet-rs-wide limitation)
**Issue:** cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown fails
**Root Cause:** onig_sys (tokenizer dependency) requires native C library
**Auto-fix:** N/A (BitNet-rs-wide architectural limitation)
**Residual Risk:** None (CPU and GPU targets unaffected)

## Routing Decision

**Decision:** READY FOR PROMOTION (Route A)

**Next Stage:** `ready-promoter` for Draft→Ready status change

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Update GitHub PR status: `gh pr ready 461`
2. Add promotion label: `gh pr edit 461 --add-label "state:ready-for-review"`
3. Remove in-progress label: `gh pr edit 461 --remove-label "state:in-progress"`
4. Route to merge workflow after maintainer approval
