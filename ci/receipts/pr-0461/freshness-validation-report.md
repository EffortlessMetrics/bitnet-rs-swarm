## Routing Decision

### Selected Route: `hygiene-finalizer`

**Rationale:**
1. **Branch Status:** Fully current (0 commits behind)
2. **Semantic Compliance:** 100% (7/7 commits)
3. **Rebase Workflow:** Maintained (0 merge commits)
4. **Conflicts:** None detected
5. **Microloop Position:** Next stage in intake microloop

### Alternative Routes NOT Taken

**rebase-helper:**
- ❌ Not needed - branch is current with 0 commits behind
- ❌ Ancestry check passed
- ❌ No divergence from base branch

**breaking-change-detector:**
- ❌ Not applicable - changes are additive only
- ❌ All modifications opt-in via environment variable
- ❌ No API contract changes

**docs-reviewer:**
- ⏭️ Deferred - will be validated in quality-validator stage
- ℹ️ Documentation appears comprehensive (7 files)
- ℹ️ Diátaxis framework compliance evident

## Validation Methodology

### GitHub-Native Git Analysis
1. **Remote Sync:** `git fetch --prune origin`
2. **Ancestry Check:** `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD`
3. **SHA References:** `git rev-parse HEAD/origin/main/merge-base`
4. **Divergence Analysis:** `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` (ahead)
5. **Conflict Detection:** `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD`
6. **Merge Commit Check:** `git log --oneline --merges`

### BitNet-rs Integration Patterns
- ✅ Semantic commit validation
- ✅ Branch naming convention verification
- ✅ Rebase workflow compliance
- ✅ TDD quality standard integration
- ✅ Neural network accuracy considerations
