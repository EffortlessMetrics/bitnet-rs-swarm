# Check Run: generative:gate:spec

**Issue:** #462 - Implement CPU Forward Pass with Real Inference (Cross MVP)
**Ledger Issue:** #463
**Flow:** Generative (1.3/8 - issue-validator)
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

---

## Summary

Issue Ledger validated; ACs: 7/7 testable; Story → Schema → Tests → Code: traceable. Infrastructure ready (CPU engine seam at cpu.rs:263, QuantizedLinear paths operational, KV cache/sampling/CLI present). Quantization requirements aligned (I2S/TL1/TL2 native paths, strict mode enforcer, receipt verification framework). Cross-validation feasible (xtask crossval integration point clear). Risk mitigation defined (10 risks with validation checkpoints). Test strategy complete (AC → Test mapping with validation commands, deterministic inference documented).
