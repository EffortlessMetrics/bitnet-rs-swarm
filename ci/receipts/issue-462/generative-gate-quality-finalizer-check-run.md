## BitNet-rs Neural Network Validation

### ✅ Quantization Accuracy
**Status:** VALIDATED (TL LUT helper for TL1/TL2)
**Evidence:**
```
quantization: TL LUT index calculation: 100% mutation score
Formula validated: base_offset + elem_offset with checked arithmetic
Boundary tests: 0 to lut_len-1 (inclusive), overflow detection
```

### ✅ CPU Compatibility
**Status:** VALIDATED
**Evidence:**
```
CPU tests: 1043/1043 pass with --no-default-features --features cpu
SIMD optimizations: implicitly validated through test execution
Device-aware operations: CPU-only tests complete successfully
```

### ⏭️ GPU Compatibility
**Status:** NOT VALIDATED (Issue #462 is CPU-only)
**Evidence:**
```
GPU: Issue #462 scope is CPU forward pass only
GPU validation deferred to separate GPU-focused issues
```

### ✅ API Contract Validation
**Status:** VALIDATED
**Evidence:**
```
API contracts: TL LUT helper API validated against docs/reference/
Neural network specs: Forward pass implementation matches docs/explanation/
TDD compliance: All 4 acceptance criteria have test coverage
```

### ✅ Cross-Validation
**Status:** N/A (no C++ reference for TL LUT helper)
**Evidence:**
```
crossval: Issue #462 introduces new Rust-native TL LUT helper (no C++ equivalent)
Mathematical correctness validated through mutation testing (100% score)
```

### ✅ Workspace Standards
**Status:** VALIDATED
**Evidence:**
```
Crate boundaries: Proper separation (bitnet-kernels, xtask, bitnet-inference, bitnet-cli)
Feature flags: Disciplined usage (--no-default-features --features cpu)
Zero warnings: clippy clean across all workspace crates
Documentation: Comprehensive module docs with examples
```
