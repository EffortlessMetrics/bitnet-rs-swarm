## Summary

Implements CPU forward pass with autoregressive generation, TL lookup table helper with overflow protection, and honest compute receipt validation enforcing CPU quantized kernel symmetry.

Closes #462

## Changes

### Production Code
- **TL LUT Helper** (`bitnet-kernels/src/tl_lut.rs`, 157 lines)
  - Safe index calculation: `block_idx * block_bytes + (elem_in_block / 8)`
  - Checked arithmetic with overflow detection
  - Boundary validation against LUT length
  - 100% mutation testing coverage (6/6 mutants killed)

- **Receipt CPU Validation** (`xtask/src/main.rs`)
  - Honest compute enforcement: `compute_path == "real"`
  - CPU quantized kernel validation (i2s_*, tl1_*, tl2_*)
  - Fallback pattern rejection (dequant_*, fp32_*, fallback_*)
  - Silent CPU fallback detection for GPU backend
  - 88% mutation testing coverage (14/16 mutants killed)

### Test Coverage
- **43 new tests** across 5 test files
  - AC1 (CPU Forward Pass): 4 tests ✅
  - AC2 (CLI Inference): 4 tests ✅
  - AC3 (Receipt Validation): 12 tests ✅
  - AC4 (TL LUT Helper): 11 tests ✅
  - Hardened Integration: 16 tests ✅

### Documentation
- CHANGELOG.md: Added Issue #462 entries
- docs/reference/quantization-support.md: TL LUT API reference
- docs/development/test-suite.md: Mutation testing achievements
- docs/howto/validate-models.md: CPU receipt validation workflow

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC1:** CPU forward pass with autoregressive generation from BOS token
- [x] **AC2:** CLI inference with `bitnet-cli infer --backend cpu`
- [x] **AC3:** Receipt CPU validation with quantized kernel enforcement
- [x] **AC4:** TL LUT helper with checked arithmetic and overflow detection

## Testing

### Test Results
- **Workspace tests:** 1043/1043 pass

- **Mutation testing:** 91% overall (threshold: 80%)
  - TL LUT: 100% (6/6 mutants killed)
  - Receipt: 88% (14/16 mutants killed)

## Breaking Changes

None. This is a new feature with no API changes to existing functionality.

## Migration Guide

Not applicable (new feature addition).

## Neural Network Validation

- **Quantization Accuracy:** TL LUT formula validated with 100% mutation coverage
- **Device-Aware:** Proper CPU feature gating throughout
- **Receipt Honesty:** Enforces compute_path="real" and CPU kernel symmetry
- **Zero-Copy:** No unnecessary allocations in hot paths

## Artifacts

**Issue Ledger:** [ci/receipts/issue-462/LEDGER.md](ci/receipts/issue-462/LEDGER.md)
- 12 agent hops (spec → impl → quality → doc → prep)
- All gates passed (format, clippy, tests, mutation, build, diff)
- 91% mutation score (exceeds 80% enterprise threshold)
