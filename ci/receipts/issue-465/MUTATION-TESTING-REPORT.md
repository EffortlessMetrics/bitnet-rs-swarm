# Mutation Testing Report: Issue #465 CPU Path Followup

## Executive Summary

**Status:** SKIPPED (documentation-and-tooling-only)
**Gate:** generative:gate:mutation
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Flow:** Generative

## Key Findings

Issue #465 contains **zero production code changes**. All modifications are limited to:
- Documentation (README.md)
- Test infrastructure (tests/)
- Test fixtures (tests/fixtures/)
- CI baselines and receipts (docs/baselines/, ci/receipts/)

**Mutation testing is not applicable** for this issue as there is no production code to mutate.

## Analysis Details

### Production Code Changes: 0

```
Files changed (30 total):
- Documentation: 1 (README.md)
- Baselines: 1 (docs/baselines/20251015-cpu.json)
- Test files: 5 (tests/issue_465_*.rs)
- Test fixtures: 23 (tests/fixtures/issue-465/*)
- CI receipts: 0 (will be added by this gate)
```

### Test Suite Validation

Since production code was not changed, we validated the test suite itself:

**Test Coverage:**
- Total tests: 54 (all passing)
- Test files: 4 main test files + 1 utilities module
- Test structure:
  - Baseline tests: 15 tests
  - CI gates tests: 11 tests (1 ignored - requires GitHub API)
  - Documentation tests: 14 tests
  - Release QA tests: 14 tests

**Test Quality Indicators:**
✅ Comprehensive edge case coverage
✅ Negative testing patterns present
✅ Strict schema validation
✅ Deterministic configuration enforced
✅ CPU kernel ID hygiene checks
✅ Receipt validation utilities

### Test Utilities Analysis

The `issue_465_test_utils.rs` module provides reusable test infrastructure:

**Core Functions:**
1. `workspace_root()` - Path resolution with fallback
2. `configure_deterministic_env()` - Reproducible test setup
3. `find_cpu_baseline()` - Baseline file discovery
4. `verify_receipt_schema()` - v1.0.0 schema validation
5. `has_cpu_kernel_ids()` - CPU kernel pattern matching
6. `create_test_receipt()` - Test fixture generation
7. `git_tag_exists()` - Git repository validation

**Code Quality:**
- Proper error handling with `anyhow::Result`
- Context-rich error messages
- Support for multiple schema field aliases (backward compatibility)
- Comprehensive parameter validation
- Unit tests for critical functions (3 tests)

## Mutation Testing Standards (BitNet-rs)

For reference, if production code had been changed, the following thresholds would apply:

| Component Type | Mutation Score Threshold |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Core neural network modules (quantization, kernels, inference) | ≥80% |
| Supporting infrastructure | ≥70% |
| Documentation-only changes | N/A (skipped) |

## Recommendations

### For This Issue (Issue #465)

**Status:** FINALIZE → fuzz-tester

Since this is a documentation and test infrastructure issue with zero production code changes:
1. ✅ Test suite is comprehensive (54 tests, all passing)
2. ✅ Test utilities demonstrate good engineering practices
3. ✅ Schema validation is strict and thorough
4. ✅ Edge cases are well-covered
5. → **Proceed to fuzz-tester gate** for edge case validation

### For Future Changes

If Issue #465 evolves to include production code:
1. **Re-run mutation testing** on affected crates:
   ```bash
   cargo mutants --no-shuffle --timeout 120 -p bitnet-quantization --no-default-features --features cpu
   cargo mutants --no-shuffle --timeout 180 -p bitnet-kernels --no-default-features --features gpu
   cargo mutants --no-shuffle --timeout 120 -p bitnet-inference --no-default-features --features cpu
   ```

2. **Target mutation score:** ≥80% for core modules

3. **Focus areas for mutation testing:**
   - Quantization accuracy (I2_S, TL1, TL2)
   - GPU/CPU kernel parity
   - Inference engine robustness
   - GGUF compatibility

### Test Infrastructure Reuse

Consider extracting utilities from `issue_465_test_utils.rs` to common test infrastructure:
- `verify_receipt_schema()` → `bitnet-tests/common/receipt_validation.rs`
- `has_cpu_kernel_ids()` → `bitnet-tests/common/kernel_validation.rs`
- `configure_deterministic_env()` → `bitnet-tests/common/test_env.rs`

This would enable:
- Reuse across other test suites
- Centralized maintenance
- Consistent validation patterns
- Better mutation testing coverage (library code vs test code)

## Evidence Summary

**Mutation Testing Decision:**
```
mutation: skipped (documentation-and-tooling-only)
production_code_changes: 0
test_suite_quality: comprehensive (54 tests, all passing)
alternative_validation: test structure analysis, edge case coverage verification
```

**Next Gate:** fuzz-tester (edge case validation)
