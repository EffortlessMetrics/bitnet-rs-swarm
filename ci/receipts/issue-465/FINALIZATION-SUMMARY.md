### 3. Story → Schema → Tests → Code Traceability ✅

**User Story**: Clearly defined maintainer perspective for v0.1.0-mvp release polish

**Schema Mapping**:
- ✅ Documentation stream: README updates → quickstart flow → receipt verification
- ✅ Baselines stream: Deterministic CPU receipt → pinned JSON → schema validation
- ✅ CI Gates stream: Branch protection → Model Gates workflow → smoke test
- ✅ Release QA stream: Pre-tag verification → quality gates → tag creation

**Tests Mapping**:
- ✅ AC1/AC2: Copy-paste validation → README renders verified receipt
- ✅ AC3/AC4: `verify-receipt` command → passes schema validation
- ✅ AC5/AC6: Smoke test PR → blocked by branch protection
- ✅ AC9/AC10: `grep` audits → 0 legacy commands/claims
- ✅ AC11: Pre-tag verification script → all gates pass
- ✅ AC12: Tag existence → `git tag -l v0.1.0-mvp`

**Code Mapping**:
- ✅ README.md: Quickstart, receipts, feature flags, receipt-driven claims
- ✅ docs/baselines/YYYYMMDD-cpu.json: Pinned CPU baseline
- ✅ GitHub Settings: Branch protection rules
- ✅ Smoke Test PR: Negative test case
- ✅ scripts/pre-tag-verification.sh: QA checklist
- ✅ Git Tag: v0.1.0-mvp with release notes

### 4. BitNet-rs Neural Network Alignment ✅

**Workspace Crates**:
- ✅ bitnet-inference: Receipt verification, kernel execution
- ✅ bitnet-kernels: CPU kernel IDs (`i2s_*`, `tl*_*`)
- ✅ bitnet-models: GGUF loading, production 2B model
- ✅ bitnet-cli: Benchmark and verify-receipt commands
- ✅ xtask: Developer tooling for baseline generation

**Quantization Requirements**:
- ✅ I2_S quantization: 10-20 tok/s CPU performance target
- ✅ Receipt validation: `compute_path:"real"` with real kernel IDs
- ✅ Deterministic baseline: `BITNET_DETERMINISTIC=1 RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`
- ✅ Cross-validation: Parity with Microsoft BitNet C++ reference (<5% variance)

**Feature Flags**:
- ✅ All commands use `--no-default-features --features cpu|gpu` pattern
- ✅ Default features are EMPTY (explicit specification required)
- ✅ Documentation standardization enforced (AC9)

| Dependency | Status | Details |
|------------|--------|---------|
| PR #435 | ✅ MERGED | Merged 2025-10-09 13:36:49Z |
| PR #464 | ✅ MERGED | Merged 2025-10-15 12:39:51Z |
| Test Model | ✅ AVAILABLE | `tests/models/mini.gguf` (224 bytes) |
| Production Model | ✅ AVAILABLE | `models/microsoft-bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-gguf/` |
| xtask Commands | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | `benchmark`, `verify-receipt` functional |
| Baselines Directory | ✅ EXISTS | `docs/baselines/` with validation fingerprints |
| Branch Protection | ❌ NOT CONFIGURED | Manual admin action required (AC5) |

---

## Ambiguity Resolution

### 1. Model Selection

**Decision**: Use production 2B model (`models/microsoft-bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-gguf/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf`)

**Rationale**:
- `tests/models/mini.gguf` (224 bytes) is too small for realistic baseline
- Production model provides comprehensive neural network kernel coverage
- Existing baselines already reference `ggml-model-i2_s` in validation fingerprints
- Performance target: 10-20 tok/s CPU (I2_S quantization, 2B model)

**Impact**: AC3 baseline generation will use production model, ensuring realistic performance metrics

### 2. Branch Protection Approach

**Decision**: Manual admin configuration with documented steps

**Rationale**:
- Branch protection requires GitHub repository admin access
- API verification confirms: "Branch protection not configured or no access"
- Manual configuration is one-time operation (~5 minutes for admin)
- Automated `xtask configure-branch-protection` command deferred to post-MVP

**Impact**: AC5 documents manual steps; AC6 provides smoke test validation

**Mitigation**: Documentation provides fallback process; manual PR review until admin configures

### 3. Performance Baseline Range

**Decision**: 10-20 tok/s CPU with ±5% tolerance for timing variance

**Rationale**:
- BitNet paper performance targets for I2_S quantization on CPU
- Kernel-level determinism (exact kernel IDs) with timing variance acceptable
- ±5% tolerance accounts for CPU throttling, system load
- Receipt proves exact kernel execution (deterministic compute path)

**Impact**: AC3/AC4 baseline generation and verification use this performance envelope

---

## Blocker Analysis and Mitigation

### Primary Blocker: Branch Protection (AC5)

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Status**: DOCUMENTED
**Impact**: Requires GitHub repository admin access

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Short-term**: Document manual configuration steps for admin
2. **Validation**: Admin confirms configuration via GitHub UI or API
3. **Smoke Test**: AC6 provides negative test case to verify blocking behavior
4. **Fallback**: Manual PR review process until admin configures protection
5. **Long-term**: Create `xtask configure-branch-protection` command (post-MVP)

**Timeline**: Admin action required (estimated 1-2 hours once access granted)

### Secondary Consideration: Test Model Adequacy

**Severity**: LOW
**Status**: RESOLVED
**Impact**: `mini.gguf` too small for realistic baseline

**Resolution**:
- Use production 2B model instead of tiny test model
- Model availability confirmed: `models/microsoft-bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-gguf/` directory exists
- Download time: ~5-10 minutes (2GB file, one-time cost)
- Baseline generation: ~2 minutes with production model

- Deterministic benchmark runs with `BITNET_DETERMINISTIC=1 RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`
- Pre-tag verification checklist: clippy, tests, benchmark, receipt verification
- Cross-validation against Microsoft BitNet C++ reference

### Documentation Standards ✅
- README quickstart: 10-line CPU flow (build → run → verify)
- Receipt verification: xtask commands + environment variables reference
- Feature flag standardization: `--no-default-features --features cpu|gpu` pattern
- Receipt-driven performance claims (no legacy unsupported claims)

### Storage Conventions ✅
- Baselines: `docs/baselines/` (pinned CPU/GPU receipts)
- Specifications: `docs/explanation/` (issue specs, technical specs)
- Development: `docs/development/` (build commands, GPU setup, test suite)
- Reference: `docs/reference/` (quantization support, validation gates)
